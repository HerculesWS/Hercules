party_update_interval: 1000

// Method used to update party-mate hp-bars:
// 0: Aegis - bar is updated every time HP changes (bandwidth intensive)
// 1: Athena - bar is updated with the party map dots (up to 1 second delay)

// as the current leader. (Note 1)

// When 'Party Share' item sharing is enabled in a party,
// announce in the party which party-member received the item and what's he received? (Note 1)

party_item_share_type: 0

// Is exp/item sharing disabled for idle members in the party?
// Set to 0, or the amount of seconds (NOT milliseconds) that need to pass before considering
// a character idle.

// A character's idle status is reset upon item use/skill use/attack (auto attack counts too)/movement.

// Give additional experience bonus per party-member involved on even-share parties (excluding yourself)?
// ex. If set to 10, an even-share party of 5 people will receive +40% exp (4 members * 10% exp):
