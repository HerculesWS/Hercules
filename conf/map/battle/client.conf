// Battle (Client) Configuration File
//=========================================================================
// Note 1: Value is a config switch (true/false)
// Note 2: Value is in percents (100 means 100%)
// Note 3: Value is a bit field. If no description is given,
//         assume unit types (1: Pc, 2: Mob, 4: Pet, 8: Homun, 16: Mercenary)
//=========================================================================

// Whether to enable the official packet obfuscation support (good vs WPE)
// 0: disabled
// 1: optional (not recommended) -- identifies whether it is required
// 2: enabled (recommended)
packet_obfuscation: 1

// Minimum delay between whisper/global/party/guild messages (in ms)
// Messages that break this threshold are silently omitted.
min_chat_delay: 0

// Valid range of dyes and styles on the client.
min_hair_style: 0
max_hair_style: 29
min_hair_color: 0
max_hair_color: 8
min_cloth_color: 0
max_cloth_color: 4
min_body_style: 0
max_body_style: 4

// When set to true, the damage field in packets sent from woe maps will be set
// to -1, making it impossible for GMs, Bots and Hexed clients to know the
// actual damage caused by attacks. (Note 1)
hide_woe_damage: true

// "hair style" number that identifies pet.
// NOTE: The client uses the "hair style" field in the mob packet to tell them apart from mobs.
// This value is always higher than the max hair-style available in said client.
// Known values to work (all 2005 clients):
// older sakexes: 20
// sakexe 0614: 24
// sakexe 0628 (and later): 100
pet_hair_style: 100

// Visible area size (how many squares away from a player can they see)
area_size: 14

// Maximum walk path (how many cells a player can walk going to cursor)
// default: 17(official)
max_walk_path: 17

// Maximum allowed 'level' value that can be sent in unit packets.
// Use together with the aura_lv setting to tell when exactly to show the aura.
// NOTE: You also need to adjust the client if you want this to work.
// NOTE: Default is 99. Values above 127 will probably behave incorrectly.
// NOTE: If you don't know what this does, don't change it!!!
max_lv: 99

// Level required to display an aura.
// NOTE: This assumes that sending max_lv to the client will display the aura.
// NOTE: aura_lv must not be less than max_lv.
// Example: If max_lv is 99 and aura_lv is 150, characters with level 99~149
//          will be sent as being all level 98, and only characters with level
//          150 or more will be reported as having level 99 and show an aura.
aura_lv: 99

// Units types affected by max_lv and aura_lv settings. (Note 3)
// Note: If an unit type, which normally does not show an aura, is
//       set it will obtain an aura when it meets the level requirement.
// Default: 0 (none)
client_limit_unit_lv: 0

// Will tuxedo and wedding dresses be shown when worn? (Note 1)
wedding_modifydisplay: false

// Save Clothes color. (This will degrade performance) (Note 1)
save_clothcolor: true

// Save body styles? (Note 1)
// Note: Don't turn this on unless you know what your doing.
//       Sprites are not released officially.
save_body_style: false

// Do not display cloth colors for the wedding costume?
// Note: Both save_clothcolor and wedding_modifydisplay have to be enabled
// for this option to take effect. Set this to true if your cloth palettes 
// pack doesn't has wedding palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
wedding_ignorepalette: false

// Do not display cloth colors for the Xmas costume?
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Xmas palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
xmas_ignorepalette: false

// Do not display cloth colors for the Summer costume?
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Summer palettes (or has less than the other jobs)

// Do not display cloth colors for the Hanbok costume?
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Hanbok palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
hanbok_ignorepalette: false

// Show Hercules version to users when the login?
display_version: false

// When affected with the "Hallucination" status effect, send the effect to client? (Note 1)
// Note: Set to false if the client lags due to the "Wavy" screen effect.
display_hallucination: true

// Set this to 1 if your client supports status change timers and you want to use them
// Clients from 2009 onward support this
display_status_timers: true

// Randomizes the dice emoticon server-side, to prevent clients from forging
// packets for the desired number. (Note 1)
client_reshuffle_dice: true

// Sorts the character and guild storage before it is sent to the client.
// Official servers do not sort storage. (Note 1)
// NOTE: Enabling this option degrades performance.
client_sort_storage: false

// Duration of client's self mute in minutes.
// Note: Do not enable this, if you enabled commands for players,
// because the client sees multiple commands in succession as spam.
// Default: 0 (means disabled)
client_accept_chatdori: 0

// Limits use of blank (transparent) pixels in guild emblems to a set
// percentage of the total.
// Official servers do not enforce this technically to date, but some disallow
// use of blank emblems in their rules. (Note 2)
// A value of 100 (allowing 100% blank pixels) disables this check.
// NOTE: Enabling this option slightly degrades performance.
client_emblem_max_blank_percent: 100
