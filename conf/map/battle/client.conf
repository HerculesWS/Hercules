// Battle (Client) Configuration File
//=========================================================================
// Note 1: Value is a config switch (true/false)
// Note 2: Value is in percents (100 means 100%)
// Note 3: Value is a bit field. If no description is given,
//         assume unit types (1: Pc, 2: Mob, 4: Pet, 8: Homun, 16: Mercenary)
//=========================================================================

// Whether to enable the official packet obfuscation support (good vs WPE)
// 0: Disabled
// 1: Optional (Not recommended) -- identifies whether it is required
// 2: Enabled (Recommended)
packet_obfuscation: 2

// Minimum delay between whisper/global/party/guild messages (in milliseconds)
// Messages that break this threshold are silently omitted.
min_chat_delay: 0

// Valid range of dyes and styles on the client.
min_hair_style: 0
max_hair_style: 29
min_hair_color: 0
max_hair_color: 8

max_cloth_color: 4
min_body_style: 0
max_body_style: 4

// When set to true, the damage field in packets sent from WoE maps will be set to -1,
// making it impossible for GMs, Bots and modified clients to know the actual damage caused by attacks. (Note 1)
hide_woe_damage: true

// "hair style" number that identifies pet.
// NOTE: The client uses the "hair style" field in the mob packet to tell them apart from mobs.
// This value is always higher than the max hair-style available in said client.
// Known values to work (all 2005 clients):
// older sakexes: 20
// sakexe 0614: 24
// sakexe 0628 (and later): 100
pet_hair_style: 100

// Visible area size (how many squares away a player can they see from his position)
area_size: 14

// Chat area size (how many squares away from a player can they chat)
chat_area_size: 9

// Area size which monster death packets should be sent to.
// This should be set to the farthest distance a player can reach in 250ms after a monster dies.
// Setting this to (area_size + 18) (18 being the range of Monk's Snap skill) should be a great value.
dead_area_size: 32

// Maximum walk path (how many cells a player can walk going to cursor)
// Default: 17 (Official)
max_walk_path: 17

// Maximum allowed 'level' value that can be sent in unit packets.
// Use together with the aura_lv setting to tell when exactly to show the aura.
// NOTE: You also need to adjust the client if you want this to work.
// NOTE: Default is 99. Values above 127 will probably behave incorrectly.
// NOTE: If you don't know what this does, don't change it!!!
max_lv: 99

// Level required to display an aura.
// NOTE: This assumes that sending max_lv to the client will display the aura.
// NOTE: aura_lv must not be less than max_lv.
// Example: If max_lv is 99 and aura_lv is 150, characters with level 99~149
//          will be sent as being all level 98, and only characters with level
//          150 or more will be reported as having level 99 and show an aura.
aura_lv: 99

// Units types affected by max_lv and aura_lv settings. (Note 3)
// Note: If an unit type, which normally does not show an aura, is set
//       it will obtain an aura when it meets the level requirement.
// Default: 0 (none)
client_limit_unit_lv: 0

// Will tuxedo and wedding dresses be shown when worn? (Note 1)

// Save clothes color. (This will degrade performance) (Note 1)
save_clothcolor: true

// Save body styles? (Note 1)
save_body_style: true

// Do not display cloth colors for the Wedding costume? (Note 1)
// Note: Both save_clothcolor and wedding_modifydisplay have to be enabled for this option to take effect.
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has wedding palettes (or has less than the other jobs)

// Do not display cloth colors for the Xmas costume? (Note 1)
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Xmas palettes (or has less than the other jobs)

// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Summer palettes (or has less than the other jobs)

// Do not display cloth colors for the Hanbok costume? (Note 1)
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Hanbok palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
hanbok_ignorepalette: false

// Do not display cloth colors for the Oktoberfest costume? (Note 1)
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Oktoberfest palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
oktoberfest_ignorepalette: false

// Do not display cloth colors for the Summer 2 costume? (Note 1)
// Set this to true if your cloth palettes pack doesn't has Summer 2 palettes (or has less than the other jobs)
summer2_ignorepalette: false

// Show Hercules version to users when they login? (Note 1)
display_version: false

// When affected with the "Hallucination" status effect, send the effect to client? (Note 1)
// Note: Set to false if the client lags due to the "Wavy" screen effect.
// Note: This has been changed to an "Upside Down" view instead of "Wavy" screen effect in latter clients.
display_hallucination: true

// Display status change timers in game? (Note 1)
// Note: Only clients from 2009 onward support this.

// Randomizes the dice emote server-side, to prevent clients from forging packets for the desired number. (Note 1)
client_reshuffle_dice: true

// Sort the character and guild storage before it is sent to the client? (Note 1)
// Default: false (Official behavior)
// Note: Enabling this option degrades performance.
client_sort_storage: false

// Duration of client's self mute in minutes.
// Note: Do not enable this, if you enabled commands for players,
// because the client sees multiple commands in succession as spam.
// Default: 0 (means disabled)
client_accept_chatdori: 0

// Limits use of blank (transparent) pixels in guild emblems to a set percentage of the total. (Note 2)
// Official servers do not enforce this technically to date, but some disallow use of blank emblems in their rules.
// A value of 100 (allowing 100% blank pixels) disables this check.
// Note: Enabling this option slightly degrades performance.
client_emblem_max_blank_percent: 100

// Show the MVP EXP reward message for clients 2013-12-23cRagexe and newer? (Note 1)
// kRO removed the packet and this re-enables the message.
// Default: false (Official behavior)
mvp_exp_reward_message: false

// Display the same HP value as official servers do when a character is dead? (Note 1)
// On official servers, HP is never displayed as 0, but when dead, they display the value that
// will be shown after resurrection (50% HP for novice class, 1 HP for other classes).
// Athena servers, instead, show the real value (0 when dead), to avoid confusion.
// Note: this is only a visual setting, and the server will internally handle it as 0 regardless of this.
// This means that scripts will know that the character has 0 HP when dead.
// Default: true (Official behavior)
display_fake_hp_when_dead: true

// Send ping timer
// For clients 2019-03-20 RE+
// Interval in seconds for each timer invoke.
