// % of the current exp bar. (Every 10 = 1.0%)
// For example, set it to 500 and no matter how much exp the mob gives,
// it can never give you above half of your current exp bar.
max_exp_gain_rate: 0

// Method of calculating earned experience when defeating a monster:
// 0 = Uses damage given / total damage as damage ratio
// 1 = Uses damage given / max_hp as damage ratio
// NOTE: Using type 1 disables the bonus where the first attacker gets
//       his share of the exp doubled when multiple people attack the mob.
exp_calc_type: 0

// Experience increase per attacker. That is, every additional attacker to the
// monster makes it give this much more experience.

// The rate of job exp from using Heal skill (100 is the same as the heal amount, 200 is double) (Note 2)

heal_exp: 0

// The rate of exp gained when revived by another player (Resurrection, Redemptio, Yggdrasil Leaf),
// in 0.01% increments - 100 is 1%, 10000 is 100%.
// Base and job experience are only gained if the resurrected player's base and job level, respectively,
// are higher than the resurrecting player.
// The amount of gained experience is calculated as:
// (current experience * level difference / 100 * resurrection_exp / 10000)

// The rate of job exp when using discount and overcharge on an NPC
// (in 0.01% increments - 100 is 1%, 10000 is normal, 20000 is double)
