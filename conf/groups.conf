/*

Player groups configuration file
---------------------------------

This file defines "player groups" and their privileges.

Each group has its id and name, lists of available commands and other
permissions, and a list of other groups it inherits from.


Group settings
--------------
<id>
Unique group number. The only required field.

<name>
Any string. If empty, defaults to "Group <id>". It is used in several @who
commands.

<level>
Equivalent of GM level, which was used in revisions before r15572. You can set
it to any number, but usually it's between 0 (default) and 99. Members of
groups with lower level can not perform some actions/commands (like @kick) on
members of groups with higher level. It is what script command getgmlevel()
returns. Group level can also be used to override trade restrictions
(db/item_trade.txt).

<commands>
A group of settings
	<command name> : <bool>
or
	<commandname> : [ <bool>, <bool> ]
First boolean value is for atcommand, second one for charcommand. If set to
true, group can use command. If only atcommand value is provided, false is
assumed for charcommand. If a command name is not included, false is assumed
for both atcommand and charcommand.
For a full list of available commands, see: doc/atcommands.txt.
Command names must not be aliases.

<log_commands>
Boolean value. If true then all commands used by the group will be logged to
atcommandlog. If setting is omitted in a group definition, false is assumed.
Requires 'log_commands' to be enabled in 'conf/logs.conf'.

<permissions>
A group of settings
	<permission> : <bool>
If a permission is not included, false is assumed.
For a full list of available permissions, see: doc/permissions.txt

<inherit>
A list of group names that given group will inherit commands and permissions
from. Group names are case-sensitive.

Inheritance results
-------------------
Both multiple inheritance (Group 2 -> Group 1 and Group 3 -> Group 1) and
recursive inheritance (Group 3 -> Group 2 -> Group 1) are allowed.

Inheritance rules should not create cycles (eg Group 1 inherits from Group 2,
and Group inherits from Group 1 at the same time). Configuration with cycles is
considered faulty and can't be processed fully by server.

Command or permission is inherited ONLY if it's not already defined for the
group.
If group inherits from multiple groups, and the same command or permission is
defined for more than one of these groups, it's undefined which one will be
inherited.
