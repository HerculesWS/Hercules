// The rate of time it takes to cast a spell (Note 2, 0 = No casting time)
casting_rate: 100

// Delay time after casting (Note 2)
delay_rate: 100

// Does the delay time depend on the caster's DEX and/or AGI? (Note 1)
// Note: On Official servers, neither Dex nor Agi affect delay time
delay_dependon_dex: no
delay_dependon_agi: no

// Minimum allowed delay for ANY skills after casting (in milliseconds) (Note 1)
// Note: Setting this to anything above 0 can stop speedhacks.
min_skill_delay_limit: 100

// This delay is the min 'can't walk delay' of all skills.
// NOTE: Do not set this too low, if a character starts moving too soon after
// doing a skill, the client will not update this, and the player/mob will
// appear to "teleport" afterwards.
default_walk_delay: 300

//Completely disable skill delay of the following types (Note 3)
//NOTE: By default mobs don't have the skill delay as specified in the skill
//  database, but follow their own 'reuse' skill delay which is specified on
//  the mob skill db. When set, the delay for all skills become
//  min_skill_delay_limit.

// accounting attack motion (ASPD) for casting skills (Note 2, between 0 and 300)
//
// NOTE: Setting this to 100% may cause some issues with valid skills not being cast.
//       The time difference between client and server varies so allowing 90% leniency
//       should be enough to forgive very small margins of error.

// Will normal attacks be able to ignore the delay after skills? (Note 1)
skill_delay_attack_enable: yes

// If the target moves out of range while casting, do we take the items and SP for the skill anyway? (Note 1)
skill_out_range_consume: no

// Does the distance between caster and target define if the skill is a ranged skill? (Note 3)
// If set, when the distance between caster and target is greater than 3 the skill is considered long-range, otherwise it's a melee range.
// If not set, then the range is determined by the skill's range (if it is above 5, the skill is ranged).
// Default 14 (mobs + pets + homun)
skillrange_by_distance: 14

// Should the equipped weapon's range override the skill's range defined in the skill_db for most weapon-based skills? (Note 3)
// NOTE: Skills affected by this option are those whose range in the skill_db are negative. By default always the skill range is used.
// Note that if you want all monster skills to have a range of 9 you need to set monster_ai&0x400.
skillrange_from_weapon: 0

// When songs are canceled, terminated or the character goes out of the
// area of effect, there's an additional effect that lasts for 20 seconds
// Should that time be reset for each song?

// 1: Yes, recasting songs reset the 20 seconds timer (eathena)
song_timer_reset: 0

// Whether placed down skills will check walls (Note 1)
// (Makes it so that Storm Gust/Lord of Vermillion/etc when cast next to a wall, won't hit on the other side)
skill_wall_check: yes

// When cloaking, Whether the wall is checked or not. (Note 1)
