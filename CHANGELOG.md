- Renamed the arguments of the `aMalloc()`, `aCalloc()`, `aStrndup()`, `aRealloc()`, `aReallocz()` macros to make it harder to accidentally swap their order. (#3280)

### Fixed

- Fixed `expandinventory()` not allowing to return to the initial minimum inventory size. (#3270)
- Fixed a race condition allowing for a call to `clif->pLoadEndAck()` before the client's loadendack is received. (#3277)
- Fixed a memory leak of emblem data when guilds are unloaded or disbanded. (#3278)
- Fixed several instances of swapped arguments in `aCalloc()` calls, causing warnings in gcc-14. (#3280)
- Fixed a regression causing AutoSpell not to replace the selected skill when the new skill has lower level than the previous one. (#3282)

### Other

- Updated copyright headers for year 2024.

## [v2023.12] `December 2023`

### Added

- Added a warning when enabling the RoDEX account box on unsupported client packetvers. To continue using this feature with patched RE clients it is necessary to uncomment the `ENABLE_RODEX_ACCOUNT_MAIL_RE_PATCH` macro in `core.h`. (#3263)
- Added a warning when a script sends account mails when the feature is disabled on the server. (#3263)
- Added an option to allow combo skills requested during previous skill's delay to be accepted (and queued up for execution), making them easier to trigger especially by players with high latency. The option can be enabled by setting `combo_cache_skill` to `true` in `conf/map/battle/skill.conf`. (#3260, #3266)
- Added constants for all `messages.conf` messages replacing a large amount of magic numbers. The maximum number of messages is now defined in `common/msgtable.h` as `MSGTBL_MAX`. See the related pull request description for a conversion tool that may be used to migrate custom constants. (#3265)

### Changed

- Enabled the RoDEX account box by default since the default packetver supports it. (#3263)
- Improved the error messages, providing additional useful details, when a char server's connection request to the login server is rejected. (#3264)
- Cleaned up some repetition from the job name switches, replaced with X macro using the `class*.h` files. See the pull request description for migration details in case of custom jobs. (#3265, related to #165)

### Fixed

- Fixed the `snap_dodge` setting not working with `MO_EXTREMITYFIST`. (#3241, issue #638)
- Fixed stat food and cash stat food being stacked on top of each others. Cash food of higher level is able to overwrite buffs from normal food, while normal food won't overwrite buffs from cash food. (#3250, issue #2489)
- Fixed some SC counters (including Storm Gust) not getting reset to 0 when a unit dies. (#3255, issue #3196)
- Fixed costumes blocking itemskill execution, even when items are being consumed. (#3257, related to issue #2925)
- Fixed a race condition that may cause SC statuses to be received after the character status calculations are done, when the server is under heavy load. (#3256)
- Fixed a compiler warning caused by swapped aCalloc arguments. (#3264)
- Fixed the `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` animation not workingn when there's no possible chainable combo skill. (#3259)
- Removed an incorrect `afterCastActDelay` from `PA_SACRIFICE` in pre-renewal. (#3259)
- Removed the fixed target from some combo skills. Monk skills act on the current target even if the last skill was used on a different enemy. (#3259)
- Fixed `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` overwriting `attackabletime`. (#3259)
- Fixed combo delays applying to all `SC_COMBOATTACK` based skills and not sending the proper time to the client. (#3259)
- Fixed one cell movement not ignoring hidden objects (such as GMs) in its stack limit calculation. (#3259)

### Removed

- Removed nearly identical redundant Visual Studio solutions for different versions. Only one version is kept, compatible with all the supported VS versions. The AppVeyor CI configuration is updated accordingly. (#3262, #3267, #3268)

## [v2023.11] `November 2023`

### Added

- Added an option to use an unit's current facing direction to search for free cells, instead of defaulting to east. (#3242)
  - The option, currently disabled by default, can be turned on by setting `keep_dir_free_cell` (`conf/map/battle/misc.conf`) to true.
  - Advantages:
    - Improves distribution of mobs when dispersing after being grouped. This setting allows monsters to spread in a circular fashion instead of forming a long horizontal line.
    - Allows characters to move more naturally if they came from the east, instead of walking back.
    - In some instances, fixes characters walking in a loop unable to pick up an item. (#1241)

### Changed

- Changed the map server's behavior when receiving invalid connections with unknown protocols to terminate the connection after receiving the second byte. (#3247)
- Disabled the possibility of attaching a script to a character in autotrade mode through `attachrid()`. This solves a number of issues with many script commands assuming a client to be attached. (#3243, issue #568)
- Updated map list, mapcache, NPC and hateffect constant databases. (#3249)
- Extracted the Blade Stop (Root) trigger conditions to a separate function for better readability and maintainability. (#3254)

### Fixed

- Fixed some job concurrency conflicts in the GitHub Actions workflows causing some tests to be skipped for pushes to the master branch. (#3239)
- Consolidated the GitHub Actions workflow entry point to always be the 'controller' regardless of the trigger condition. (#3239)
- Fixed `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` not applying the same motion delay as the client in the case the next combo is not possible, causing visual glitches. (#3240)
- Fixed the `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` delay formula increasing delay with dex instead of decreasing it. (#3240)
- Fixed an issue causing characters to be stuck in a walk loop while trying to pick up an unreachable item on the ground. (#3242, issue #1241)
- Fixed a deprecation warning issued by MariaDB causing CI test failures. (#3247)
- Fixed range and cast time for `ASC_BREAKER`. (#3245, issue #1104)
- Fixed `SA_DISPEL` not working in duels. (#3246, issue #640)
- Added support for GRF files larger than 2 GiB on Windows, fixing failures in mapcache generation. (#3248, issue #2935)
- Fixed songs not triggering their onleft or onout events when overlapping and turning into dissonance. (#3251, issue #1501)
- Fixed the range checks of Blade Stop/Root: (#3254)
  - Fixed the target's (as in triggering attack target, and Blade Stop caster) equipped weapon wrongly affecting the skill's working range.
  - Success range is changed to 2, to match the official behavior.
  - In pre-re, changed it to always succeed against player attackers regardless of range.
  - Changed it to always succeed for non-player casters regardless of range (custom Hercules behavior, officially only players may cast Blade Stop).
- Fixed `CELL_NOSTACK` making mob ai not being able to reach target under certain conditions. (#3244, issue #574)
- Fixed the critical bonus calculation from status effects getting truncated to 0.3 CRIT per point of LUK instead of 1/3. (#3252, issue #3094)

# [v2023.10] `October 2023`

### Added

- Added an option to synchronize the flinch animation with walk delay, improving positional lag. The option is disabled by default, uncomment the `WALKDELAY_SYNC` definition in `src/config/core.h` to enable it. (#3232)
- Implemented logic to generate "item links" serverside and the related script command `getitemlink()`, including various core functionalities this relies on. (#3236, #3238)
  - This also adds basic support for the `base62` encoding used by the client.

### Changed

- Refactored Auto Spell (Hindsight) and moved its configuration to a libconfig table. (#3237)
  - The configuration is available in the `{re,pre-re}/autospell_db.conf` file, see the documentation in the file header.
  - The separation between game logic (in `skill.c`) and client/display logic (in `clif.c`) has been improved.
  - Cast end logic has been separated from the large skill castend function into smaller dedicated functions.
  - The function `skill->autospell()` has been renamed to `skill->autospell_spell_selected()` to make its purpose clearer.
  - This refactoring will simplify some of the upcoming rebalance changes.
- Added concurrency settings to the GitHub CI workflows to cancel old ongoing builds when a new commit is pushed, speeding up testing the up to date version. (#3238)

### Fixed

- Fixed the HPMHooking API plugin builds in VS 17.x (#3231)
- Fixed `AM_ACIDTERROR` not ignoring defense on units other than those defined in `battle_config.vit_penalty_target` (i.e. players). (#3234)
- Fixed Sage's free case increasing ASPD instead of decreasing it when the skill level is lower than 10. (#3235)
- Fixed the `clang-13` build in the GitHub CI, failing due to a removed package in debian unstable. (#3238)
- Fixed AppVeyor CI builds, failing due to a missing `mysql56` image. (#3238)

## [v2023.08] `August 2023`

> Note: with this release the versioning scheme has slightly changed: the release day is no longer included in the release tag and is set to `00` in the `HERCULES_VERSION` constant. Hotfix releases will take the form `v2023.08.001` ~ `v2023.08.999` (and will set `HERCULES_VERSION` to `202308001` ~ `202308999`). Releases will still happen around the second wednesday of each month when possible.

### Added

- Added support for choosing between localtime and UTC output in the script command `gettime()` (defaults to localtime for backward compatibility). (#3224)
- Added support for choosing between localtime and UTC input in the script command `getcalendartime()` (defaults to localtime for backward compatibility). (#3224)
- Added the `GETTIMETICK_*` constants to be used with the `gettimetick()` script commands. It's recommended to update custom scripts to use the constants instead of numbers, as there is no guarantee that the values will not change in the future. (#3224)
- Added an option to allow Venom Dust to give experience points. See `venom_dust_exp` in `conf/battle/battle.conf`. (#3226, issue #3188)
- Added the missing `common/packets_struct.h` include to `HPMapi.c` and `HPMlogin.c`. (#3228)

### Changed

- Changed Poisoning Weapon to show the type of poison used when applied. (#3219)
- Moved the `GETTIME_*` constants to source. (#3224)
- Documented a quirk of `gettimetick(GETTIMETICK_HOUROFDAY_S)` (formerly known as type 1) when the server is running with a local timezone on the day daylight savings begin or end. (#3224)
- Changed `gettimetick()` to reject unknown types instead of defaulting to type 0. (#3224)

### Fixed

- Fixed a typo in the `sc_start()` rate description in the command documentation. (#3219)
- Fixed the duration and rate of Poisoning Weapon getting reduced more than they were supposed to be. (#3219)
- Fixed the duration of the Venom Bleed poison effect. (#3219)
- Fixed a missing VS 2022 solution for the HPMHooking API plugin. (#3222)
- Fixed `TF_DOUBLE` not granting the Hit bonus when triggered. (#3225)
- Fixed the command `getcalendartime()` returning the wrong timestamp when fed with a localtime input while daylight savings are in effect. (#3224)
- Fixed a warning about an unused variable in `npc.c` with some compilers. (#3224)
- Fixed the attendance system returning the wrong timestamp when the server is running on a local timezone and daylight savings are in effect. (#3224)
- Fixed temporary skills not getting cleared from the skill tree on recent clients when the item granting them is unequipped. (#3227, issue #3209)

## [v2023.07.12] `July 12 2023`

### Added

- Added a macro to toggle the logging of login/logout events in the API server. Disabled by default, uncomment the `DEBUG_ONLINEDB_LOG` definition in `aclif.c` to enable it. (#3207)
- Added support for `skill_db2.conf` to extend/override the skill DB. Just like the item and mob databases, it supports the `Inherit` field to allow overriding part of a skill's entry without having to copy the rest. (#3216)

### Changed

- Increased the default value of the API server setting `remove_disconnected_delay` from 5000 to 50000. (#3207)
- Reduced the timeout in the GitHub Actions CI scripts to 60 minutes, to avoid stuck jobs preventing further builds from starting for 6 hours and wasting a large amount of runner minutes. (part of #3217)
- Replaced some lengthy pieces of repeated code in the skill DB parser with a loop. (part of #3216)
- Changed case-insensitive checks to case-sensitive for many database fields: (#3216)
  - `SkillInfo` flag names
  - `SkillType` flag names
  - `DamageType` flags names
  - `Requirements/WeaponTypes` flags names
  - `Requirements/AmmoTypes` flags names
  - `Requirements/State` values
  - `Unit/Flag` flag names
  - `Unit/Target` values
    - NOTE: the `SameGuild` value was previously incorrectly listed as `Sameguild` in the examples and documentation. The correct version is `SameGuild`.
  - For debugging purposes, a piece of code similar to https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/files/11782956/compare_skills.diff.txt can be used to print the values before and after applying this patch, to check the differences and ensure that no unintended changes were introduced in the parsing of one's custom entries.
- Added a `target` argument to `skill->check_condition_castend()` to allow additional checks that require information about the skill's target. (part of #3215)

### Fixed

- Added some missing null pointer checks and assertions. (part of #3207)
- Added API-server related configs into the copy actions of the VS projects. (part of #3207)
- Fixed an unreliable health check in the CI builds based on MariaDB containers. (#3217)
- Fixed some interactions of `MO_KITRANSLATION`. (#3215)
  - It should fail with a skill failure message and not consume requirements when: (#3215)
    - being cast on Gunslinger class
    - being cast on a player that already has 5 spheres
    - being cast on friendly non-player units (e.g. Mercenary)
- Fixed some interactions of `MO_ABSORBSPIRITS`. (#3215)
  - It should fail and not consume SP when:
    - the target player doesn't have spheres
    - the target player is of Gunslinger class (due to teh game implementation not allowing them to have spheres)
    - the target player is friendly
  - It should fail and consume SP when:
    - used on a BOSS monster
    - used on a non-boss monster, but failing the 20% check
    - used on non-player units (like mercenaries)
  - moved the target check to condition cast end
- Fixed the error message when a gunslinger is attempting to use a skill that requires coins without having the necessary amount. (#3215)
- Fixed the stacking of `WM_POEMOFNETHERWORLD` to match the behavior described in the 2012.08.22 official patch notes: (#3215)
  - it cannot be placed over another instance of the skill
  - when trying to do so, it should show a position error to client

## [v2023.06.14] `June 14 2023`

### Added

- Implemented the Unit Parameters DB, to allow splitting some battle configs into separate pre-renewal and renewal databases and fine tune them in configuration groups associated to each job. (#3214)
  - The new database is in [db/pre-re/unit_parameters_db.conf](db/pre-re/unit_parameters_db.conf) / [db/re/unit_parameters_db.conf](db/re/unit_parameters_db.conf) and it is referenced by the job db through the new `ParametersGroup` field.
  - Support for plugins to extend the DB is provided, through `addToUnitParam()`, `getfromUnitParam()`, `removefromUnitParam()`.
  - The following fields are available, with the respective macros to access them from the source:
    - `MaxHP` (replaces `battle_configuration/max_hp`) - `pc_maxhp_cap(sd)`
    - `MaxASPD` (extends `battle_configuration/max_aspd` and supersedes `battle_configuration/max_third_aspd`) - `pc_max_aspd(sd)`
    - `MaxStats` (extends `battle_configuration/max_parameter` and `battle_configuration/max_third_parameter`, supersedes `battle_configuration/max_extended_parameter`, `battle_configuration/max_summoner_parameter`, `battle_configuration/max_baby_parameter`, `battle_configuration/max_baby_third_parameter`) - `pc_maxstats(sd)` (replaces `pc_maxparameter(sd)`)
    - `NaturalHealWeightRate` (replaces `battle_configuration/natural_heal_weight_rate`) - `pc_overhealweightrate(sd)` and the helper `pc_isoverhealweight(sd)` (replaces `pc_is50overweight(sd)`)
  - The `MaxHP` field supports defining level ranges to make the parameter vary based on the character's level.
  - Detailed documentation is available in [doc/unit_parameters_db.md](doc/unit_parameters_db.md)
  - Additional upgrade notes including an upgrade cheatsheet can be reviewed in the pull request description at https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/pull/3214

### Changed

- Changed the animation delay to be applied at castbegin instead of castend, to match official behavior. `skill_amotion_leniency` now defaults to 0 which offers a more accurate official behavior. Users that wish to block more speedhacks may still increase it. (#3187, issue #2703)
- Changed the player's maximum HP to be capped differently based on the player's level (Renewal, episode 15.1). (part of #3214, related to issue #243)

### Fixed

- Fixed some (false positive) `sprintf()` overflow warnings. (#3212)

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated `LGTM` badge from the main README. (#3211)
- Removed the following battle configuration settings, superseded by the unit parameters db - see above for details: (part of #3214)
  - `battle_configuration/max_hp`
  - `battle_configuration/max_third_aspd`
  - Note: `battle_configuration/max_aspd` still exists but is only used for Homunculus and as a fallback for players whose job can't be determined
  - `battle_configuration/max_extended_parameter`
  - `battle_configuration/max_summoner_parameter`
  - `battle_configuration/max_baby_parameter`
  - `battle_configuration/max_baby_third_parameter`
  - Note: `battle_configuration/max_parameter` and `battle_configuration/max_third_parameter` are retained since some logic still depends on them
  - `battle_configuration/natural_heal_weight_rate`

## [v2023.05.10] `May 10 2023`

### Added

- Added support to clone the definition of an item in the `item_db`. A cloned item inherits all the fields (except item ID and AegisName) of its original, allowing a compact definition with only the fields that differ. See the definition of `CloneItem` in [doc/item_db.txt](doc/item_db.txt) for details. (#3206)
- Added the script commands `openquestui()` and `opentipboxui()`. (#3201)

### Changed

- Updated the Thanatos Tower with its Renewal changes (only affecting Renewal mode), based on the official patch notes, until before the revamp update. (#3204)
  - Changes from 2012.04.04 kRO Patch:
    - It is no longer required to have several players near the NPC to move to the 3rd floor
  - Changes from 2016.06.29 kRO Patch:
    - Burled Request quest exp reward updated:
      - Base EXP: 120,000 -> 1,200,000
      - Job EXP : 100,000 -> 1,000,000
    - Burled Request quest required level changed
      - No level requirement -> Level 91 or higher required
    - Changed weapon level required to progress Burled Request quest
      - Level 4 Weapon -> Level 3 or 4 Weapon
    - Changed restrictions to enter upper floors of the tower with a Black Key
      - Before: Reborn, 3rd classes or Expanded jobs level 95 or above
      - Now: Any character level 95 or above
  - Edited lines were also updated to current Hercules' standards and HULD
- Disabled full request logging in the api server. (#3203)
- Added the warning flag `-Wenum-int-mismatch` to the build settings. (#3203)
- Extended the `ZC_OPEN_UI` packet functions to allow passing the `data` field as a parameter. (part of #3201)

### Fixed

- Added the missing EXP rewards for the Amatsu Dungeon quest. (#3205)
- Fixed errors in the MinGW builds (#3203)
  - Added a missing stdbool.h include.
  - Fixed the plugin file extension.
- Added a check for an empty char server response in the API handler `emblem_download` (i.e. when requesting the emblem of a nonexistent guild). (#3203)
- Fixed the unit-specific `dmg_taken_rate` getting ignored in favor of the database-defined value (mostly when using `setunitdata(UDT_DAMAGE_TAKEN_RATE, ...)`. (#3202)
- Added the missing documentation for the `openbank()` script command. (#3201)
- Fixed handling of multiple RoDEX item claim requests (such as when retrieving multiple attachments at once) by queuing up the requests. (#3189, issues #3186, 3009)

## [v2023.04.12] `April 12 2023`

Note: everything included in this release is part of PR #3198 which consists of 301 commits. To avoid extreme redundancy the PR link will not be repeated for each line of the changelog.

### Added

- Added a brand new fourth server (api-server) to support HTTP-based client features as well as, potentially, third party tools
  - The api-server listens by default on port 7121.
  - The server is a separate process and can be started in the same way as login, char and map servers.
  - Configuration can be found in `conf/api/` and supports the same import mechanism as the other servers.
  - HPM plugins are supported in the same way as login, char and map servers and sample plugins are included.
  - The api-server can be customized (i.e. through HPM plugins) to provide an easily accessible HTTP API for use by third party tools that want to communicate with the Hercules server.
  - The server offers some built-in basic protection (limiting connections by IP, limiting request and headers size, trusted IPs, etc.), but as with any externally exposed service, caution is recommended, and a system administrator should decide whether it is necessary to use additional forms of filtering (such as a judiciously configured reverse proxy or web application firewall) for public deployments.
  - The connection interfaces are as follows:
    - client - api-server (`aclif`)
    - login-server (`lapiif`) - api-server (`aloginif`)
    - char-server (`capiif`) - api-server
    - map-server (`mapiif`) - api-server
  - The http parser library can be switched at compile time to llhttp (`--with-http_parser=llhttp`) and defaults to `http-parser` (`--with-http_parser=http-parser`)
  - Visual Studio solutions have been updated (as a best-effort approach, those files are unmaintainable and are looking to be replaced by a generator such as CMake in order to avoid repetition and desynchronization). Xcode project has not been updated at the current time.
  - Some parameters can be edited at compile time to alter various behaviors. See `src/api/aclif.h`, `src/api/httpsender.h`, `src/api/mimepart.h`, `common/apipackets.h` for a list of macros that can be redefined (undocumented and may have unexpected side-effects, edit after familiarizing with the code that uses them).
- Added support for user configuration in clients that support the HTTP API at the `/userconfig/load` and `/userconfig/save` endpoints
  - emotes are persisted by the char server into the `emotes` table (SQL migration is included), default emotes can be edited in `conf/emotes.conf`
  - hotkeys (v1) are currently not supported
  - hotkeys (v2) are persisted by the char server into the `hotkeys` table (SQL migration is included)
- Added support for character settings in clients that support the HTTP API at the `/charconfig/load` endpoint
- Added support for guild emblems in clients that support the HTTP API at the `/emblem/upload` and `/emblem/download` endpoints
  - Supports BMP (static) and GIF (static or animated) emblems
  - The `emblem_data` field in the `guild` table has been changed to a `mediumblob` (SQL migration is included)
  - Validation parameters can be changed in `conf/common/emblems.conf`
- Added support for party/adventurer agency functions in clients that support the HTTP API at the `/party/list`, `/party/get`, `/party/add`, `/party/del` endpoints
  - Search is currently not supported
  - Adventurer agency data is persisted by the char server into the `adventurer_agency` table (SQL migration is included)
  - A new module (`int_adventurer_agency`) has been added to the char server
- Added the following third party libraries, used by the api-server:
  - http-handler from the node-js http-parser (`3rdparty/http-parser`)
  - multipart-parser (`3rdparty/multipart-parser`)
  - cJSON (`3rdparty/cJSON`)
  - llhttp (`3rdparty/llhttp`)
  - GIFLIB (`3rdparty/libgif`)
- Extended the SQL interface with the `SQL->QueryStrFetch()` method, to execute a query and fetch a row.
- Added support for sending/receiving chunked packets (for sending and receiving packets that would exceed the maximum packet size)
  - See related macros in `src/common/chunked/rfifo.h` and `src/common/chunked/wfifo.h`
  - Tests are included, in `src/test/test_chunked.c`
  - Chunked packets are usable for both server-server and client-server communication
- Added `extraconf` interface (currently supporting `conf/common/emblems.conf`) for configuration files used by multiple servers

### Changed

- The `create_session()` function is now part of the socket interface and adds support for configurable connection and termination handlers.
- The `delete_session()` function is now part of the socket interface.
- Updated token generation in the login server to support communication with the API server.
- Updated gitignore with temporary files from python and ccache.
- Updated handling of packet `CZ_REQ_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG` (now `PACKET_CZ_REQ_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG1`) to use the struct format and added the `PACKET_CZ_REQ_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG2` and `CZ_REQ_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG3` variants.
- Updated handling of packets `ZC_CHANGE_GUILD`, `ZC_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG`, `CHARMAP_GUILD_EMBLEM`, `CHARMAP_GUILD_INFO`, `CHARMAP_GUILD_INFO_EMPTY`, `MAPCHAR_GUILD_EMBLEM` to use the struct format.
- Updated packets `ZC_CHANGE_GUILD`, `ZC_GUILD_EMBLEM_IMG`.
- Renamed `clif->guild_emblem_area()` into `clif->guild_emblem_id_area()`.
- Renamed `DEFAULT_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL` to `DEFAULT_CHAR_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL` and `DEFAULT_MAP_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL` to avoid conflicting definitions of the same macro.
- Extended the `console.console_msg_log` (`conf/global/console.conf`) setting to work on all servers instead of just the map server.
  - Log filenames will be named accordingly: `log/login-msg_log.log`, `log/char-msg_log.log`, `log/map-msg_log.log`, `log/api-msg_log.log`.
- Changed `emblem_data` in `struct guild` to be a pointer instead of a fixed size array (this may require updates to any custom code copying or allocating/deallocating the struct).
- Switched to python3 for all the debian/ubuntu jobs in Gitlab-CI
- Enabled memory leak on exit checks to the address sanitizer configuration for CI builds

### Fixed

- Fixed a compilation error with ccache.
- Fixed packetvers in `clif_friendslist_send()`.

## [v2023.03.08] `March 08 2023`

### Added

- Added documentation for include overrides in configuration files (#3191)
- Implemented the DynamicNPC Create request packets and the related script command `dynamicnpcresult()`. An example can be found in `npc/other/dynamicnpc_create.txt`. (#3192)
- Implemented support for the GoldPC UI (a.k.a. Mileage), disabled by default, which can be enabled from `conf/map/battle/feature.conf` for packetver `20140611` and newer. (#3192)
  - The initial implementation includes two modes (single and double), configurable in `db/goldpc_db.conf`, and selectable in `feature.conf`.
  - An example NPC can be found in [doc/sample/goldpc.txt](doc/sample/goldpc.txt), demonstrating the use of the GoldPC system script commands (`setgoldpcmode()`).
  - A custom GoldNPC NPC is spawned by players upon clicking the GoldPC button, see `npc/other/goldpc.txt`.
  - Further documentation of the system is available in [doc/goldpc.md](doc/goldpc.md).

### Changed

- Added paths for include overrides to .gitignore so that they won't show up as untracked in git status or risk getting committed by accident. Those that wish to commit them to their fork are still free to do so by issuing a git add command. (#3191)

### Fixed

- Fixed the `RA_WUGBITE` immobile status (#2813)
- Fixed the `SC_FEINTBOMB` cloak status not working (#2813)
- Fixed an UnknownStatusChange error triggered by `SC__BLOODYLUST` (#2813)

## [v2023.01.11] `January 11 2023`

### Added

- Added a skeleton function for generating an auth token. This doesn't add actual token generation capabilities at this time, but allows plugins to hook into it to implement custom behavior. (#3183)
- Added the missing effects of Fire Expansion level 3 and 4 (#2920)

### Changed

- Changed `validateinterfaces.py` to run on python3. (#3185)
- Changed the CI builds to use python3 instead of python2, as it's getting removed by linux distributions including debian unstable. (part of #3185)
- Changed the `show_monster_hp_bar` option to show the HP bar on WoE guardians when it's enabled for Emperium (flag '2', disabled by default) instead of when it's enabled for MvPs/bosses (flag '4', also disabled by default.) (#2931, related to #2008, #2912)

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing package `php-dom` in CI builds. (part of #3185)

### Other

- Updated copyright headers for year 2023.

## [v2022.12.07] `December 07 2022`

### Added

- Added the `nosendmail` mapflag, adding the ability to prevent players from sending emails (RODEX and classic) from a map. (#2962)
- Added the `item_drop_bonus_max_threshold` configuration flag in `conf/map/battle/drops.conf`, making the item bonus rate cap configurable. (#3136)

### Changed

- Updated `script_commands.txt`, fixing typos and incorrect file names, adding documentation for missing `checkoption()` flags and updating some external URLs. (#3177)

### Fixed

- Added some missing checks for null in `sd->inventory_data` pointers to prevent crashes. (#3176)
- Fixed the item bonus rate cap getting applied to the base item drop rates and the server's drop rate modifiers, making their real values different from what `@mi` shows. The cap now only applies to drop-time bonuses (cash shop SCs, race-specific drop rate modifiers, luk or size custom influence, renewal level modifiers, etc). (part of #3136)

## [v2022.11.02+1] `November 02 2022` `PATCH 1`

### Added

- Added support for newer packetvers/encryption keys/client messages (up to 20221019). (#3174)
- Added support for packet `ZC_SPECIALPOPUP` related to the Special Popup messages. (part of #3174)
- Implemented script command `specialpopup()` to open a popup and/or show a chat text message from the `spopup.lub` file. An example script has been provided in `npc/custom/specialpopup.txt`. (#3174)
- Implemented the `specialpopup` mapflag, to automatically show the popup text configured clientside. All GvG maps have been configured to show popup with type 1. (#3174)

### Changed

- Updated many packets with the correct Zero client packetver checks. (part of #3174)
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use the latest packetver. (part of #3174)
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to include a gcc-12 build. (part of #3174)

### Fixed

- Fixed a conflicting variable name `pinfo`, causing warnings about shadowed variables when building plugins. (part of #3174)

### Removed

- Removed the unused value `vendinglistType` from `enum packet_headers`. (part of #3174)

## [v2022.11.02] `November 02 2022`

### Added

- Updated the map cache and map list with new maps. (#3156)
- Updated the NPC ID constants and Hat effect constants with new IDs. (part of #3156)
- Implemented the package item selection UI for recent clients that support it. (#3158)
  - A new item type, `IT_SELECTPACKAGE` is defined for this purpose (see the `Select_Example1` item).
- Added support for constants and bitmask arrays in `mob_skill_db.conf`, for the `ConditionData`, `val<n>` and `Emotion` fields. (#3164, issue #2768)
- Exposed monster modes (`MD_*` constants) to the script engine. (part of #3164)
- Implemented the `@quest` atcommand, to manipulate a character's quest log. (#3166)
- Implemented the Rebuilding the Destroyed Morroc quests from episode 14.3. Note: the quests (except the reward NPCs) are disabled by default. (#3167)
- Implemented the Enchant User Interface for clients that support it. (#3159)
  - The enchantments are defined in the newly introduced `db/*/enchant_db.conf` database.

### Changed

- Refactored `status->get_sc_def()` and its call chain (including `status->change_start()` and the `sc_start*()` macros to include the skill ID, used for SC immunity checks. (part of #3155)
- Updated the CodeQL GitHub workflow to follow the latest upstream templates. (part of #3169)
- Removed duplication and consolidated the functions of the `itemdb->lookup_const()` / `mob->lookup_const()` functions as `map->setting_lookup_const()`. (part of #3164)
- Moved the function `itemdb->lookup_const_mask()` into the map interface as `map->setting_lookup_const_mask()`. (part of #3164)
- Renamed the `BA_FROSTJOKER` skill and related constant to the official name `BA_FROSTJOKE`. The old name is left behind as a deprecated constant, to ease migration of custom code. (#3170)
- Split `constants.md` into `constants_re.md` and `constants_pre-re.md`, since there are large variations in the available constants and their values between modes. The generator plugin and related CI script have been updated accordingly. (#3171)
- Refactored and simplified some code after the removal of the multi-zone leftovers. (part of #3173)
  - Cheatsheet for updating custom code:
    - `MAX_MAP_SERVERS` has been removed, and any code that used it in a loop needs to be refactored to remove the loop that is no longer necessary.
    - `chr->server[]` has become `chr->map_server` (and it's a single object rather than an array of one element).
    - packet `H->Z` 0x2b04 (`chrif->recvmap()`) has been removed without a replacement as it was never sent.
    - many functions that took a `map_id` / `server_id` argument no longer need it (since it would be always zero). Code that used it likely needs to be refactored or removed.
    - packet `H->Z` 0x2b20 (`chrif->removemap()`) has been removed without a replacement as it was never sent.
    - `mapif->sendallwos()` has been removed without a replacement as it never sent anything since there couldn't be more than one map server connected at any given time.
    - `mapif->sendall()` is replaced by `mapif->send()` (but mind the different return value).
    - `mapif->send()` no longer requires a server id argument since there can only be one (and its return value changed).
    - several pieces of code have been completely removed since they were not reachable through any code path: any custom code part of them was likely never called and can be safely removed.
    - `map->map_db` and any related functions have been removed, as it could never get populated.
    - `chrif->other_mapserver_count` and any related functions have been removed, as it could never become nonzero.
    - packets `Z->H` 0x2b05 and `H->Z` 0x2b06 have been removed as they could never be sent.
    - `chr->search_mapserver()` and `chr->search_default_maps_mapserver()` have been completely overhauled and their purpose is now fulfilled by `chr->mapserver_has_map()` and `chr->find_available_map_fallback()`, with different return values and arguments.
    - the `map_fd` argument has been removed from several non-mapif functions that should have no business with it. The map server's fd can be retrieved through `chr->map_server.fd`, but in most cases it shouldn't be necessary and could be a code smell.
    - the `chrif->changemapserver()` function has been removed with no replacement as it was never called.
    - the `server` field of `struct online_char_data` has been replaced with an enum and renamed to `mapserver_connection`. It no longer encodes the server ID (since it could only be zero) but only the connection state. The old `-2` special value maps to `OCS_UNKNOWN`, `-1` to `OCS_NOT_CONNECTED` and `>= 0` to `OCS_CONNECTED`.
- Moved the `chrif` packet documentation to `packets_chrif_len.h`, where the packet lengths are defined. (part of #3173)

### Fixed

- Fixed/implemented Official behavior for the Golden Thief Bug Card, blocking SCs caused by magic-type skills, regardless of the SC type. (#3155)
  - Exceptions apply: Magnificat, Gloria and Angelus are blocked, even if they aren't magic-type skills.
  - Some skills that would be broken now have temporary workarounds to apply the right behavior if it doesn't match what their type dictates.
  - The `NoMagicBlocked` flag has been removed from skills that no longer require it.
- Fixed the `AttackType` for many skills to match the official value. (part of #3155)
- Fixed the zeny payments through the Stylist UI to be properly logged and count toward achievements. (#3157)
  - This includes a potentially very long running database migration for the logs database (adding the picklog type '5').
- Fixed `PF_SOULCHANGE` to match the official behavior, preventing its use against characters in the Berserk state and against boss monsters and allowing it to disregard `SC_FOGWALL`. (#3160)
- Fixed a case of the Doctor Quest taking items and not rewarding in return, as well as some `delitem()` that aren't executed in the same run loop as `countitem()`. (#3162)
- Fixed some possible exploits in the Pickocked Quest, allowing only one instance of the NPC to be available at any time. (#3162)
- Fixed the Dual Monster Race logic to disregard the relative order of the winning monsters and simplified the script logic. (#3162)
- Fixed Kihop wrongly counting the bearer Taekwon for the bonus calculation. (#3161)

- Fixed the cast time and after cast delay of Napalm Beat. (#3161)
- Fixed `CH_CHAINCRUSH` not working after `MO_COMBOFINISH`. (#3161)
- Fixed several security issues (including a number of false positives) reported by CodeQL (overflows, misleading implicit type conversions, ambiguous regular expressions, etc) and refactored some related code to reduce dangerous variable reuses. (#3169)
- Fixed some cases of movement notifications sent to the client after a monster dies, causing visual glitches such as mobs not cleared and still standing or moving after their death. (#3163, issues #2047, #2109)
- Fixed an integer overflow in the image size for the Macro interface. (#3165)
- Fixed a failed assertion when a quest has 3 objectives. (#3166)
- Fixed various quest related packets sent to the client. (#3166)
  - Fixed the labelling for quests that use monster size, race or element as conditions.
  - Fixed swapped values for the mob size.
  - Fixed the mob ID not being sent for special cases (with map names, races, sizes or elements) and requiring a new log in to see the correct quest objectives.
- Fixed the Zeny retrieval process from RoDEX, causing potential loss of Zeny. (#3168)
- Fixed output character encoding in the `setup_mariadb.ps1` script. (#3172)
- Fixed a buffer overflow in `mapif->rodex_getitemsack()`. (part of #3173)

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed the `itemdb->lookup_const()` and `mob->lookup_const()` functions, replaced by `map->setting_lookup_const()`. (part of #3164)
- Removed the `itemdb->lookup_const_mask()` function, replaced by `map->setting_lookup_const_mask()`. (part of #3164)
- Removed support for the deprecated `View` field in the item DB, replaced in 2016 by `ViewSprite` and `SubType` with #1828. (#3170)
- Removed the deprecated constants `Job_Alchem` and `Job_Baby_Alchem`, replaced in 2016 by `Job_Alchemist` and `Job_Baby_Alchemist` with #1088. (#3170)
- Removed the old `VAR_*` setlook constants, deprecated since 2016 with #908. (#3170)
- Removed the `useatcmd()` script command, deprecated in 2017 with #1841. (#3170)
- Removed code (mostly dead code) related to the long unsupported and long broken multi-zone functionality. (#3173)

## [v2022.10.05] `October 05 2022`

### Added

- Added support for `UDT_OPTIONS` to `getunitdata()` and `setunitdata()`, allowing to interact with mobs that are using job sprites. (#3146)
- Implemented the `AllowPlagiarism` `SkillInfo` flag in the skill DB and the `INF2_ALLOW_PLAGIARIZE` source code counterpart, allowing separate per-skill settings for Plagiarize and Reproduce. (#2948)
- Added support for newer packetvers/encryption keys/client messages (up to 20220831). (#3152)
- Added support for preview in the old cash shop packet. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by defining `ENABLE_OLD_CASHSHOP_PREVIEW_PATCH` or through the configure flag `--enable-old-cashshop-preview-patch`. A client patch is necessary, available at http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/ExtendOldCashShopPreview (part of #3152)
- Implemented the Item Reform user interface on supported clients (2020 and newer). The feature can be configured through the `item_reform_info.conf` and `item_reform_list.conf` db files. (#3150)

### Changed

- Replaced use of `safesnprintf()` with the C99 standard `snprintf()`. (part of #3148)
- Improved detection of the usability of `-Wformat-truncation`, disabling it on older gcc versions where it doesn't produce useful warnings. (part of #3148)
- Refactored and fixed some Plagiarize/Reproduce related code. (part of #2948, issue #989)
- Updated the list of third job skills that can be plagiarized. (part of #2948)

### Fixed

- Fixed the gcc version specific GitHub CI builds that were running Ubuntu 21.10, which is EOL. LTS versions are now preferentially used, where possible. (#3147)
- Fixed HWSAPI run failures caused by a missing XML::Parser perl module (872aebe2d3)
- Fixed the `UDT_CLASS` option of `setunitdata()` to set the view data's class if a mob uses a job class ID. (part of #3146)
- Fixed some improper use of `safesnprintf()`/`snprintf()`, potentially causing truncation at the wrong position or buffer overruns. (part of #3148)
- Fixed text in old clients in packet `ZC_NOTIFY_CHAT_PARTY`. (#3149)
- Code style fixes. (part of #3149)
- Fixed an interaction issue between copied (Plagiarize/Reproduce) skills and ones already present in the character's skill list. (part of #2948, issue 2940)

### Removed

- Removed the `safesnprintf()` function, superseded by the C99 standard function `snprintf()`. Note: in case of truncation, `snprintf()` returns the amount of characters that would have been written if the buffer wasn't limited, while `safesnprintf()` returns a negative value. Care should be used when replacing the function in third party code. (#3148)
- Removed the `copyskill_restrict` battle config setting, superseded by the configurable per-skill restrictions. (part of #2948)

## [v2022.06.01] `June 01 2022`

(#3128, #3131, #3142)
- Reimplemented the "HWSAPI" build bot functionality (automatic HPM hooks updates, SQL item/mob/mobskill database generation, constants documentation generation) as a GitHub Actions workflow, migrating away from a legacy self-hosted homebrewed buildbot. (#3144)
- Updated CodeQL GitHub Action to v2. (part of #3144)

- Fixed mercenaries showing with the "Unknown" name when idling, spawning or walking. (#3143)
- Fixed `clif->item_movefailed()` (and the `ZC_MOVE_ITEM_FAILED` packet) to send the correct item amount. (part of #3142)
- Fixed `soundeffect()` and `soundeffectall()`'s `PLAY_SOUND_REPEAT` mode not working as intended. (part of #3142)
- Changed many scripts that were incorrectly using the `PLAY_SOUND_REPEAT` mode of `soundeffect()` to `PLAY_SOUND_ONCE`, as their behavior was equivalent before. (part of #3142)
- Fixed a missing linebreak in the nullpo callback console error message. (part of #3142)
- Fixed some issues around instance destruction, causing visual glitches and assertion failures. (#3141)

- Fixed an uninitialized send buffer in `PACKET_ZC_ADD_EXCHANGE_ITEM` causing memory garbage to be sent to the client. (part of #3116)
- Limited the maximum string length in the script command `gettimestr()` to 1023 characters, preventing a rogue script from allocating gigabytes of memory with a single command. (part of #3116)
- Fixed some missing methods from interfaces or direct calls that bypassed the interfaces. (part of #3118)
- Fixed possible buffer overflows in clif.c and pc.c (part of #3118)
- Fixed some visual options (such as `SC_BLIND`) not getting re-sent to the client after using `@refresh`. (#3121, issue #2706)

## [v2022.01.05+2] `January 05 2022` `PATCH 2`

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing quantity in the cart item data sent to the client. (#3105)

## [v2022.01.05+1] `January 05 2022` `PATCH 1`

### Added

- Added the `GCC10ATTR()` macro, to declare an `__attribute__` annotation only in GCC >= 10.0. (part of #3104)

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing header causing HPM compilation failures. (#3104)
- Fixed warnings on GCC 9 and older versions. (part of #3104)

## [v2022.01.05] `January 05 2022`

### Added

- Added the `PRAGMA_GCC7()` macro, to specify pragma instructions only active on GCC >= 7.0 (part of #3092)
- Added the `GCCATTR()` macro, to declare an `__attribute__` annotation only in GCC and not in Clang. (part of #3092)
- Added the `GCC11ATTR()` macro, to declare an `__attribute__` annotation only in GCC >= 11.0. (part of #3092)
- Added `grfio_decode_filename()` to the grfio interface. (part of #3092)
- Added configurable steps for the roulette system. See the serverside configuration in `conf/map/battle/roulette.conf` and the clientside patches at http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/ChangeRouletteBronzeLimit http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/ChangeRouletteGoldLimit and http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/ChangeRouletteSilverLimit for more details. (#3101)
- Added support for newer 2021 packetvers/encryption keys/client messages (up to 20211229). (#3103)
- Implemented the Grade Enchanter user interface: (#3100)
  - A new configuration flag `features.grader_max_used` is added to feature.conf.
  - The `map_log.enable` flag in logs.conf has been extended with a new value.

  - NOTE: The values in the database aren't currently official but guessed.
  - NOTE: Item protection is not supporter on older clients.
  - NOTE: This requires a database migration for the picklog and zenylog tables. The migration shouldn't cause a full table rebuild on recent versions of MySQL and MariaDB that allow appending new values to the end of enums.

### Changed

- Updated the warning flags in the configure script with new ones for recent versions of GCC and Clang. (part of #3092)
- Added annotation attributes to the functions in memmgr and strlib and some other prtinf-like functions. (part of #3092)
- Changed the memory allocation functions to never return a NULL pointer. (part of #3092)

  - `iMalloc->malloc()` (and functions or macros that use it) will allocate a 1-byte buffer if requested to allocate 0 bytes.
- Improved several packet generation functions, removing an unnecessary memcpy. (#3102)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that caused the script conditional feature checks to always be true (i.e. make the setting to disable the GM management scripts ineffective). (#3096)
- Fixed `MO_CALLSPIRITS` in `bAutoSpell` (such as the Greatest General card) to use the specified skill level instead of the currently learned level. (#3095)
- Fixed an error when saving the homunculus exp when reaching the maximum level through `@homlevel`. (#3098, issue #3097)
- Fixed various possible buffer overflows and other warnings reported by recent versions of GCC and Clang. (part of #3092)
- Fixed a memory issue caused by reloading the git/svn information on non-windows platforms where it's generated at compile time. (part of #3092)
- Fixed the SP bar not correctly updating for party and battleground team members in the 2021 clients that support it. (part of #3103)
- Fixed the weight in the expanded barter shop for 2019 and older clients. (part of #3103)
- Fixed the Doram skill Picky Peck `SU_PICKYPECK` to be affected by Spirit of Life `SU_SPIRITOFLIFE`. (#3018)
- Fixed the double cast activation chance of the skills Picky Peck `SU_PICKYPECK` and Bite `SU_BITE`. (part of #3018)

### Other

- Updated copyright headers for year 2022.

- Added error reporting to the console when Zlib fails to decompress data. (#3090)
- Added detection of a mismatched Zlib dynamic library vs the header used when compiling and reporting of the current version on startup. (part of #3090)
- Added support for a number of 2020 and 2021 packetvers/encryption keys/client messages, including several Zero clients (up to 20211118). (#3082)
- Added support for the item grade feature: (part of #3082)
  - Added support to the relevant packets in compatible packetvers (generally starting with RE 20200723 or main 20200916)

  - Added the `@grade` atcommand.
  - Added the item DB flag `Gradable` to enable grading support for individual item IDs. and the `ITEMINFO_FLAG_NO_GRADE` to the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()` commands.
  - Added the `MAX_ITEM_GRADE` constant to the script engine.
  - Added the `@inventorylist_grade[]` output variable to `getinventorylist()`.

- Added the `setdialogalign()` script command to specify the text alignment in NPC dialogs. (part of #3082)
- Added an optional argument to display a light pillar visual effect on the item created through `makeitem()`. (#3065)

### Changed

- Improved detection of recent versions of Windows for the system information screen. (part of #3087)
- Updated the documentation of the Item DB structure to include all the new fields. (#3085)
- Updated handling of several packets (`ZC_EQUIPWIN_MICROSCOPE`, `ZC_NOTIFY_HP_TO_GROUPM`, `ZC_BATTLEFIELD_NOTIFY_HP`) to use the struct format. (part of #3082)

### Removed

- Removed Visual Studio 2015 (Hercules-14.sln) solution. Developers still using it are advised to upgrade to a newer version or to switch to GCC since backward compatibility won't be guaranteed. (part of #3087)

### Other

- The wiki page about supported platforms has been updated, as it had been neglected for a while. Notable changes:
  - Debian 11 was added, kicking out Debian 9 (no policy changes)
  - The CentOS/RHEL support policy was changed, since there no longer are matching CentOS and RHEL regular releases. This means that RHEL support cannot be guaranteed and the only CentOS version that is officially supported is CentOS Stream (and CentOS 8 until it will be EOL on December 31st)
  - Ubuntu 21.10 was added and Ubuntu 18.04 was removed (no policy changes)
  - FreeBSD 13.0 was added, kicking out FreeBSD 11.x; 12.x versions older than 12.2 are unsupported (no policy changes)
  - macOS 10.15, 11 and 12 have been added, kicking out macOS 10.13 and 10.14. GCC (latest version installed through Homebrew) is also supported as an alternative to Clang shipped with XCode. The total amount of supported versions has been increased from 2 to 3.
  - The currently supported OpenBSD version has been updated to 7.0 (no policy changes)
  - The currently supported NetBSD version has been updated to 9.2 (no policy changes)
  - The currently supported Raspberry Pi OS version has been updated to 11 (bullseye). The supported distribution is now labeled Raspberry Pi OS, rather than Raspbian, following the official naming.
  - Windows 11 21H2, Windows 10 21H2, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server v.20H2 and Windows Server 2022 were added. No policy changes but a note was added to discourage running Hercules on Windows on production servers.
  - Visual Studio 2022 17.0 was added, kicking out Visual Studio 2015. No policy changes.

## [v2021.11.03+1] `November 03 2021` `PATCH 1`

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression in the mob drop rate bonus calculation, always overriding it to 900%. (#3083)

## [v2021.11.03] `November 03 2021`

### Added

- Implemented support for conditional comments in the script engine's parser, allowing to exclude blocks of code (including top-level commands) from parsing based on a condition, in a similar fashion to ifdef directives in the C preprocessor. See [doc/script_commands.txt](doc/script_commands.txt) and the pull request description for detailed information on their use. (#3080)
- Added a setting to prevent the GM administration NPCs from loading (leveraging conditional comments). (part of #3080)
  - See `script_configuration.load_gm_scripts` in `conf/map/script.conf`.
  - The provided administrative NPCs have been updated to support this setting and third party scripters that want to do the same can put their administrative NPCs behind conditional comments controlled by the `LOADGMSCRIPTS` feature (see [doc/script_commands.txt](doc/script_commands.txt) for details.
- Implemented the `bSubSkill` item bonus, reducing damage in percentage from the specified skill. (#2970)
- Implemented the `bDropAddRace` item bonus, increasing item drop rate in percentage when killing monsters of the specified race. (part of #2970)
- Implemented the Star Emperor and the Soul Reaper job classes and their respective skills. (#3030)
- Implemented an option to ignore the Discount and Overcharge effect for a given item ID. See the Item DB flags `IgnoreDiscount` and `IgnoreOvercharge` respectively. (#3060, issue #3055)
- Implemented an SC config option `HasVisualEffect` to indicate that a skill displays a visual effect on the affected unit, de-hardcoding it from source. (#3061)
- Implemented the Instant kill state (`/item onekillmonster`), allowing GMs to kill mobs in one hit (the `@killmonster` permission is necessary). (#3063)
- Implemented support for loading captcha images on server startup (#3064)
- Implemented the Lapine Upgrade user interface. (#3068)
- Exposed the former `rodex_sendmail_sub()` function as part of the script interface, as `script->buildin_rodex_sendmail_sub()`. (part of #3071)
- Implemented a `checkhiding()` script command, returning true if a character is hidden (Hiding, Cloaking or Chase Walking but not GM Perfect Hide). See [doc/script_commands.txt](doc/script_commands.txt) for details. (part of #3081)

### Changed

- Reworked the drop rate calculation and the way drop rate bonuses stack, to better accommodate for the new `bDropAddRace` bonus. (part of #2970)
- Changed various card slot processing functions to check all of them even if an item has a limited amount of card slots, since they could contain other (non-card) enchantment items. (#3066)
- Converted the elemental damage table to libconfig. See `(pre-)-re/attr_fix.conf`. A converter script `tools/attr_fix_converter.php` has been provided in order to help converting any customized tables. (#3070)
- Added the inventory index for each item in the `@itemlist` command (part of #3071)
- Changed the ambiguous return value of `getpetinfo(PETINFO_NAME)` when no pet is found. The empty string `""` is now returned instead of `"null"`, which could ambiguously be considered a valid pet name. (part of #3079)
- Changed the WARPNPC scripted warps to behave in a consistent way to real non-scripted warps. (#3081)
  - The use of `OnTouch_` has been replaced with `OnTouch` to prevent players from holding an NPC dialogue open to abuse the serialization mechanism of the former event and block the script from triggering for other players.
  - A check for the hidden/cloaked status has been added, to match the behavior of non-scripted warps.
- Applied the above `OnTouch_` to `OnTouch` conversion to the NPCs from the Cursed Spirit quest in order to prevent the same serialization abuse and the glitches that derive from it. (part of #3081)

### Fixed

- Fixed (implemented) lazy evaluation of the ternary conditional operator in the scripting language. Only the expected branch is now executed, as opposed to both branches. (#3074)
- Fixed the behavior of the Splash Kunai (`KO_HAPPOKUNAI`) skill: (#3053, issue #1597)
  - Updated damage formula to `3 * (Kunai Atk+ Weapon Atk + Base Atk)) * (Skill Level + 5) / 5`.
  - Pierce attack modifier no longer applies to it.
  - Element comes from the kunai rather than from the weapon.
  - SP Cost gets increased and Hit count should be 1.
- Fixed the behavior of the Dragon Breath (`RK_DRAGONBREATH`) skill: (part of #3053, issue #1597)
  - It now applies the elemental modifier and ignores the target's flee.
- Fixed the behavior of the Intense Telekinesis (`WL_TELEKINESIS_INTENSE`) skill: (part of #3053, issue #1597)
  - Damage is now tripled when the skill element is Ghost.
- Fixed several warnings reported by the Visual Studio compiler (#3058)
- Fixed an incorrect condition in the WoE mob status calculation. Instead of relying on castle IDs it now correctly detects the type of WoE castle (FE or TE) and applies the appropriate status modifiers. (#3062)
- Fixed the inconsistent behavior of `getcalendartime()` when supplied with the current hour and minute. (#3072)
  - The command will now always return the next occurrence of the given time (as specified by the day of month or day of week parameter) instead of inconsistently returning today's timestamp in some cases.
- Fixed the Lord Of Death spawning script never using one of the spawn locations. (#3075)
- Fixed visual glitches in RoDEX when the first item of a character's inventory (having index 0) is added to an attachment slot. (#3071)
- Fixed visual glitches when removing parts of an item stack from an attachment slot. (part of #3071)
- Fixed some processing errors in RoDEX with newer clients, after the "bulk actions" update, that keep the rows from deleted messages on screen until refreshing and send bogus data to the server. (part of #3071)
- Fixed the message body length check in the `rodex_sendmail()` script command, now allowing for the full message length of the RoDEX system as opposed to the shorter length from the earlier Mail system. (part of #3071)
- Fixed the `map->foreachinpath()` path calculation having gaps or too narrow paths, affecting skills such as Sharpshooting. (#3076)
- Fixed the behavior of the Acid Demonstration (`CR_ACIDDEMONSTRATION`) skill: (#3077)
  - The strip effect from rogues was incorrectly applied when the Armor & Weapon Break triggers for non-player characters. Now nothing is applied instead, matching the official behavior.
- Fixed the behavior of the Mental Charge (`HLIF_CHANGE`) skill: (#3078)
  - In pre-renewal the skill now makes the caster always use the raw max MATK as base damage, as in official servers.

## [v2021.09.01] `September 01 2021`

### Added

- Added a sanity check of skill IDs against `MAX_SKILL_ID` when loading the skill database. (part of #3033)
- Added Rebellion skills, items and SCs to the Pre-Renewal database. (#3031)
- Added the `NoBBReset` flag for SC types that shouldn't be reset by the Rebellion skill Banishing Buster. (#3032)

### Changed

- Increased `MAX_SKILL_ID` to 10020 to fit all the currently existing skills. (#3033)
- Updated the list of job IDs displayed by `@jobchange`. (#3029)

### Fixed

- Fixed the mob groups reading the rate from the wrong object, resulting in the fallback value `MOBID_PORING` being returned in many cases. (#3037, issue #3036)
- Fixed typos in various documentation comments. (#3035)
- Fixed the Extreme Vacuum skill causing a permanent `SC_VACUUM_EXTREME` status when it hits several targets at the same time. (#3025, related to #2995)
- Fixed the damage of piercing critical attacks with Thanatos Card in Renewal. (#3023, issue #3022)
- Fixed the Ignition Break animation in recent (2018 and newer) clients. (#3034, issue #2511)
- Fixed the Blast Mine, Claymore Trap and Land Mine damage to ignore card damage reductions. (#3024, formerly #1149)

## [v2021.08.04] `August 04 2021`

### Added

- Added support for the official Guild Storage system, supported starting with PACKETVER 20131223. Older PACKETVERs aren't affected by this change. (#1092)
  - When the official system is enabled, a guild will require the `GD_GUILD_STORAGE` skill in order to obtain access to Guild Storage.
  - Starting with PACKETVER 20140205 it's possible to control access to the Guild Storage through permissions defined in the Guild window.
  - Since this change can lock existing guilds out of their storage until and if they invest skill points in `GD_GUILD_STORAGE`, it's possible to opt out and keep using the custom system (fixed size, no skills required) by defining the `DISABLE_OFFICIAL_GUILD_STORAGE` preprocessor macro.
  - When the official guild storage is enabled, `MAX_GUILD_STORAGE` can't/shouldn't be redefined. The `GUILD_STORAGE_EXPANSION_STEP` macro is instead provided, defining the amount of storage slots that each level of the `GD_GUILD_STORAGE` skill will provide.
  - Increasing the maximum level of the `GD_GUILD_STORAGE` skill may lead to unexpected behaviors. If you must, you'll at least need to edit the `MAX_GUILD_STORAGE` macro definition to increase the maximum skill level.
  - When this is enabled, the `MAX_GUILD_STORAGE` script constant will refer to the maximum possible guild storage, rather than the current size of a specific guild's storage.
  - This requires a database migration.

### Changed

- Moved the `map->freeblock_unlock()` call from `skill_castend_nodamage_id_unknown()` to its caller. (#3019)
- Converted the random monster databases to libconfig. See `db/*/mob_group.conf` and `db/mob_group2.conf`. A converter (`tools/mobgroupconverter.py`) is provided, in order to convert custom databases. (#3013)
- Major refactoring of the Guild Storage related code and documentation. The Guild Storage items are now held in a dynamically sized array. (part of #1092)

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash when a bl is deleted twice. `map->freeblock()` will now detect it and prevent the double deletion. (#3021)
- Fixed a damage overflow in `GN_CART_TORNADO` when a character's base strength is very high. The base str value is now capped to 130 for the skill formula's purposes. (#2927, issue #659)
- Fixed the behavior of `SC_POWER_OF_GAIA` to increase the maximum HP in percentage rather than by a fixed amount. (#2918)

### Removed

- The txt version of the random monster databases (`mob_classchange`, `mob_pouch`, `mob_boss`, `mob_branch`, `mob_poring`) is no longer supported. Custom databases need to be converted to libconfig with the provided tool. (part of #3013)

## [v2021.07.07] `July 07 2021`

### Changed

- Updated some guild-related packets to use the struct format. (#3016)

### Fixed

- Fixed off-hand damage bypassing any card reductions on the target. (#3014, issue #3011)
- Fixed indentation and extra blank lines in the renewal skill db file. (#3012)
- Fixed the use of `setunitdata()` on a mob to change that specific unit's view data instead of overwriting it globally. Any such changes will now persist in case of the mob database is reloaded. (#3006)

## [v2021.06.02] `June 02 2021`

### Added

- Added diagnostic checks around map free blocks when asan is on, to track bl double free issues. (#3005)
- Added support for checking the clients' supported features through client flags (requires a client patched with the [SendClientFlags](http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/SendClientFlags/) patch - currently supports `ENABLE_CASHSHOP_PREVIEW_PATCH` only, more to come later). See the `login_configuration/permission/check_client_flags` and `login_configuration/permission/report_client_flags_error` settings in `login-server.conf`. (#3001)
- Added support for the Rebellion skills. (#2997)

### Changed

- Updated the cooldown of Neutral Barrier (`NC_NEUTRALBARRIER`) to depend on the skill level. (#2934)
- Changed `successremovecards()` to automatically re-equip the item, for consistency with `failedremovecards()`. (part of #3004)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that prevented dual monster races from completing. (#2990, issue #2989)
- Fixed a crash with evolved homunculi. (#3008)
- Fixed mapflags in instanced maps not getting reloaded correctly after scripts are reloaded. (#3003, issue #3002)
- Fixed the visual effect of Killing Cloud (`SO_CLOUD_KILL`). (#2980, issue #2978)

- Fixed an issue that prevented a character from equipping items after attempting to use the Refine skill with no refinable items in inventory. (#3007)
- Fixed an issue that prevented the automatic re-equipping of items by `failedremovecards()` `setequipoption()`. (#3004)

## [v2021.05.05] `May 05 2021`

### Added

- Added settings to modify the chain item drop rates. See `item_rate_add_chain`, `item_drop_add_chain_min` and `item_drop_add_chain_max` in drops.conf for details. (#2983, issue #2982)
- Added a check to ensure that the `map->freeblock_lock()` and `map->freeblock_unlock()` calls are balanced (GCC only). (#2992)

### Changed

- Documented that `struct script_state::rid` can contain the GID of a mob when called through `OnTouchNPC`. (part of #3000)
- Merged the homunculus exp tables into `exp_group_db` (#2998)

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash in the `WL_WHITEIMPRISON` skill as well as possible crashes in the `ST_SWORDREJECT` and `ASC_BREAKER` skills. (#2991)
- Fixed the adoption request entry in the character context menu. (#2993)
- Fixed the Vacuum Extreme status becoming permanent until logout or death. (#2995, issue #2919)
- Fixed Free Cast ignoring other speed modifiers (bypassing speed debuffs such as Curse). (#2987, issue #2976)
- Fixed the trade restrictions for the Monster Ticket item, which should disallow dropping, trading, etc. (#2986, issue #2985)
- Fixed an issue in the custom warper NPC that caused characters to get stuck when selecting the last warp option when it wasn't set yet. (#2984)
- Fixed an error when `getarraysize()`, `soundeffectall()`, `atcommand()` or `useatcmd()` are called from an `OnTouchNPC` script. (#3000, related to issue #2989)
- Fixed `montransform()`, `clan_join()`, `clan_leave()` and `clan_master()` not reporting an error when called without RID attached. (part of #3000)
- Fixed the Water Screen skill, now deflecting the damage to the Aqua elemental spirit and healing the master by 1000 HP every 10 seconds. (#2981)
- Fixed the Guardians in WoE:SE spawning in random locations instead of their designated ones. (#2999)

### Removed

- Removed the `homunculus_max_level` and `homunculus_S_max_level` battle configuration flags, now replaced by the `exp_group_db` configuration. (part of #2998 and 32fea2586d)

## [v2021.04.05+1] `April 05 2021` `PATCH 1`

- Added support for the Baby Soul Linker job class. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Baby Gunslinger job class. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Baby Rebellion job class. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Star Emperor job class and related skill ID constants and skill database entries. Skill ID conflicts between Star Emperor and Rebellion were solved in favor of the former for renewal and the latter for pre-renewal for the time being. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Baby Star Emperor job class. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Soul Reaper job class and related skill ID constants and skill database entries. (part of #2968)
- Added support for the Baby Soul Reaper job class. (part of #2968)

### Changed

- Moved the mappings between skills and status changes (`Skill2SC` table) into the `StatusChange` field of the skill database. The `Skills` field of the `sc_config` is renamed to `Skill` and limited to one associated skill per SC. (#2971)
- Added the corresponding numeric value next to each entry in the `e_class` enum, to prevent accidental renumbering and to make lookup easier. (part of #2968)
- Added some missing constants for job IDs or separators in the `e_class` enum. (part of #2968)
- Improved validation of the `class_exp_table` of the `job_db` with additional sanity checks. (part of #2968)
- Moved the `EAJ_*` constants from `constants.conf` to the source and added the ones that were missing (`EAJ_WEDDING`, `EAJ_XMAS`, `EAJ_SUMMER`, `EAJ_BABY_SUMMONER`). (part of #2968)
- Changed the warning message displayed when a constant is redefined with the same value as previously defined to mention that it has the same value. (part of #2968)
- Renamed the `job_name()` function to `pc_job_name()`. The public interface name is still `pc->job_name()`. (part of #2968)
- Moved the job enum values into separate files (`common/class.h`, `common/class_special.h` and `common/class_hidden.h`), to be accessed through the `ENUM_VALUE()` X-macro and reduce repetition. (part of #2968)
- Added the `-Wswitch-enum` warning to the default compiler settings (with an exception for libbacktrace). (part of #2968)
- Improved validation of `job_db2`, now detecting missing jobs. (part of #2968)
- Changed some function parameters from integers to the appropriate enums. (part of #2968)
- Split the status change config into renewal and pre-renewal. (part of #2963)
- De-hardcoded the status change calculation flags, moving them from the source to the `CalcFlags` field of the `sc_config`. (#2963)

- Fixed validation of the skills cast through Improvised Song. (#2972, related to #2859, issue #2823)
- Worked around a client issue (packet containing garbage) that prevented proper validation of the Warp Portal skill use request when cast through Abracadabra, causing the caster to get stuck and unable to cast any other skills until relogging or teleporting. (#2972)

### Removed

- Removed the unused `FixedCastTime` field from the pre-renewal skill DB. (part of #2968)
- Removed the `status->set_sc()` function, no longer needed. (part of #2963)

## [v2021.03.08] `March 08 2021`

### Added

- Added support for preview in the cash shop. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by defining `ENABLE_CASHSHOP_PREVIEW_PATCH` or through the configure flag `--enable-cashshop-preview-patch`. A client patch is necessary, available at http://nemo.herc.ws/patches/ExtendCashShopPreview (#2944)
- Added a console warning if a message that is not present in `messages.conf` is requested. (#2958)
- Added the missing icons for `SC_DEFSET` and `SC_MDEFSET`. (#2953)
- Added the `SC_NO_RECOVER_STATE` status preventing HP/SP recovery and the related item bonus `bStateNoRecoverRace`. (#2956)

### Changed

- De-hardcoded the association between status changes and skills from the source code. A new field `Skills` is added to the `sc_config`, allowing to specify a list of skills for each status change entry. The macro `add_sc` has been removed from `status.c`, use `status->set_sc()` instead. (#2954)
- Converted packets `ZC_NOTIFY_SKILL`, `ZC_USE_SKILL`, `ZC_NOTIFY_GROUNDSKILL`, `ZC_SKILL_POSTDELAY` and `ZC_NOTIFY_SKILL_POSITION` to the structure format. (#2951)

- De-hardcoded the list of skills that are blocked under `SC_STASIS` and `SC_KG_KAGEHUMI`. A new pair of `SkillInfo` flags `BlockedByStasis` and `BlockedByKagehumi` has been added to the skill database. (#2959)
- Updated the item script of `Velum_Flail` to its official effects. (part of #2956)

### Fixed

- Fixed the CodeQL analysis builds in the CI. (#2946)
- Fixed a possible use after free in `unit_skilluse_id2()`. (#2947)
- Fixed the save point message of the Kafra in `alb2trea`. (#2950)
- Fixed some issues/regressions in the regeneration code: (#2952)
  - Fixed an issue that caused the SP regeneration rate bonus to be applied to the HP regeneration.
  - Fixed the HP/SP regeneration always capping to a minimum of 1, causing unintended behavior. (issue #2910)

- Fixed `successremovecard()` not running the cards' unequip scripts. (#2933, issue #2922)

## [v2021.02.08] `February 08 2021`

### Added

- Extended the quest database with new options. (#2874)
  - Mob ID can be set to 0 to allow any monster ID.
  - A monster level range can now be specified.
  - A target monster's map can now be specified.
  - A target monster's type (size, race and/or element) can now be specified.

- Added a failed assertion backtrace report in the removing player error in `unit->remove_map()`. (part of #2938)
- Added support for constants and improved error messages in the quest DB. This affects the `Mob_ID`, `Drops/ItemId` and `Drops/MobId` fields. (#2886)
- Added inheritance mechanism for the pet DB. Inheritance works in the same way as the mob and item databases, allowing to specify the `Inherit: true` flag in order to inherit (rather than overriding) an existing entry with the same Id. (#2206, issue #2181)
- Updated the map database, NPC and Hateffect constants with new data. (#2936)

### Changed

- Changed the free cell search (as used by random mob spawns or teleport) to ignore the map margins, as in official servers. The margin size defaults to the official value of 15 and can be changed by editing the `search_freecell_map_margin` setting in `misc.conf`. (#2911)
- Refactored and sanitized `map->search_freecell()`. The function has been renamed to `map->search_free_cell()` since the meaning of its return values has changed. (part of #2911)
- Refactored and documented some pet database functions and added validation of the pet DB entries before they're inserted into the database. The new constant `ITEID_PET_FOOD` has been added. (part of #2206)

### Fixed

- Fixed a signed left shift overflow in socket.c. (part of #2938)
- Fixed failing github workflows builds, switching from clang-10 to clang-11 since the former is no longer available in the Debian repositories. (part of #2938)
- Forcefully disabled the compiler flag `-fcf-protection` to avoid issues in the `setjmp()` calls. (#2938)
- Fixed some missing item IDs referenced by the quest DB in pre-re mode. (part of #2886)
- Fixed grfio issues with large grf files. (#2937)

## [v2021.01.11] `January 11 2021`

### Added

- Integrated the Renewal mob database with the correct `DamageTakenRate` value for MVPs that require it. Those MVPs have a green aura and only receive 10% of the damage dealt to them. (#2875)
- Added an enum for client action types. See `enum action_type`. (#2930)
- Added skill prerequisite checks before leveling up homunculus skills, allowing the definition of prerequisites for non-evolved or non-loyal homunculi, as it was previously limited to those. The check is disabled when the `player_skillfree` setting is enabled in the battle config. (#2807)
- Added constants for the `mercenary_delete()` script command as well as the `mercenary->delete()` function and documentation for the formerly undocumented values. See `enum merc_delete_type` and the script constants `MERC_DELETE_*`. (part of #2858, issue #2843)

### Changed

- Cleaned up mob database from redundant `MVPExp: 0` fields. (part of #2875)
- Updated packet `CZ_REQUEST_ACTNPC` to use a struct. (part of #2930)
- Changed the default mercenary delete type of the `mercenary_delete()` script command to be fired by the user (not updating loyalty). (#2843)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that caused the Sign quest to lock up and become unfinishable for everyone when a player times out or logs out under certain conditions. (#2921)
- Fixed an exploit that allowed multiple people into the solo room of the Sign quest. (part of #2921)
- Fixed a failed assertion when using the `MH_SUMMON_LEGION` skill. (#2929)

### Removed

- Removed the undocumented and meaningless return value of `mercenary->delete()`, now returning void. It was previously relying on the return value of two other functions, and ultimately always returning zero. (part of #2843)

## [v2020.12.14+1] `December 14 2020` `PATCH 1`

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash in `unit->run_hit()` caused by a regression in the last update. (#2924)

## [v2020.12.14] `December 14 2020`

### Added

- Added a warning when `setnpcdisplay()` or `setunitdata()` is called on a floating NPC. (#2907)
- Added support for RSW formats up to 2.5 for reading map water level. (#2916)
- Added a `status->check_skilluse_mapzone()` function, simplifying `status->check_skilluse()` and adding a useful plugin hooking point. (#2893)

### Changed

- Second part of the refactoring of the functions in `unit.c`, adding code documentation and following the code style guidelines. Functions have been renamed when backward compatible changes to the arguments or return values were made. (#2783)
  - Added proper documentation in doxygen-format.
  - Moved variables declaration closer to their first use
  - Corrected mistreatment on checks of non-boolean variables
  - Renamed some variables to clarify their use
  - Saved re-used calculations in variables or create local macros for them
  - Simplified logical checks / conditions when possible
  - Changed returning error-code in functions to obey code-style guidelines (Functions that are affected by this are renamed so that custom code fails to compile as to point at that change of behavior.)
  - Split too long lines according to code-style guidelines
  - Made functions use enums for directions (`enum unit_dir`), when dealing with a direction context
  - Reduced code-repetition by separating code-chunks into new functions
  - Fixed remaining code-style after applying all these changes if necessary
  - The following functions have been refactored:
    - `unit->walktobl()` (renamed to `unit->walk_tobl()`)
    - `unit->run_hit()`
    - `unit->run()`
    - `unit->escape()` (renamed to `unit->attempt_escape()`)
    - `unit->movepos()`
    - `unit->walk_toxy_timer()` (return value fix)
    - `unit->blown()` (renamed to `unit->push()`)
    - `path->blownpos()` (related to the `unit->blown()` change)
    - added `npc->handle_touch_events()` function
    - the `is_boss()` macro now returns a boolean
- Added static assertion checks to prevent `MAX_STORAGE` and `MAX_GUILD_STORAGE` from causing oversized inter-server packets (#2904)
- Disabled the HP bar on Emperium and MVP monsters by default. The configuration flag `show_monster_hp_bar` has been extended to a bitmask, to allow specifying different setting for normal monsters, Emperium and MVPs. The new default value is 1 (normal monsters only), while the value corresponding to the previous behavior is 7 (`4|2|1`). (#2821)

### Fixed

- Fixed a walk delay error in `unit_stop_walking()`. (part of #2783)
- Fixed homunculi and mercenaries not warping back to their master in time. (part of #2783)
- Reverted an unintended logical change in `unit->walk_toxy_timer()` done during the first part of the `unit.c` refactoring. (#2783)
- Fixed a warning (`Warning: #1681 Integer display width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.`) when importing the database schema in recent versions of MySQL. (#2903)
- Fixed compilation with recent versions of the MySQL/MariaDB client libraries. (#2917)
- Fixed a farming exploit at the Cursed Spirit NPC. (#2883)
- Fixed the configuration flag `monster_loot_type` not working as intended. (#2855, issue #2834)

### Removed

- Removed the unused function `skill->get_linked_song_dance_id()`. (#2906)

## [v2020.11.16] `November 16 2020`

### Added

- Added a new script command `waitingroomkick()` offering better control than `kickwaitingroomall()`. (#2048)
- Added a new function `map->get_random_cell_in_range()` to get a random cell in a square around a center cell. (part of #2882)
- Added a new function `map->get_random_cell()` imitating an official cell randomization behavior, returning a cell between a minimum and a maximum distance away from the center, in a square area. (part of #2882)
- Added `pc->calc_pvprank_sub()` to the `pc` interface to allow plugins to hook into it. (#2894)

### Changed

- Updated the list of Hat Effect ID constants with new values. (#2878)
- Updated the list of NPC Sprite ID constants with new values. (#2879)
- Renamed the `PARTY_BOOKING_JOBS` and `PARTY_BOOKING_RESULTS` macros to `MAX_PARTY_BOOKING_JOBS` and `MAX_PARTY_BOOKING_RESULTS` respectively to better suit their purpose, and refactored some related code. The macros can now also be redefined externally. (#2231)
- Extended the `warpwaitingpc()` and `waitingroom()` script commands with an argument to specify which NPC to execute the commands on, for consistency with other waitingroom commands. (part of #2048)
- Refactored `map->random_dir()`, fixed a possible runtime error and added/clarified the function documentation. (#2882)
- Changed the libconfig directive `@include "FILENAME"` directive to search inside `conf/import/include/{SERVERNAME}/{FILEPATH}` before `{FILEPATH}` allowing for example to easily override `sql_connection.conf` on a server by server basis without editing other files. (#2881)
- Improved the error messages in the mob skill DB parser to include the monster ID constants instead of just the numeric IDs. (#2884)
- Corrected the return values in the null pointer checks of `mob->skill_use()` and renamed it to `mob->use_skill()` due to the changed API. (part of #2887)
- Corrected the return values in the null pointer checks of `mob->skill_event()` and renamed it to `mob->use_skill_event()` due to the changed API. (part of #2887)
- Removed an unnecessary call to `unit->set_dir()` when the direction doesn't change in the busy `unit->attack_timer_sub()`, preventing a needless `clif->changed_dir()` broadcast. (#2891)
- Added data validation to the `rodex_sendmail*()` commands to ensure that the item amount is valid. (#2901, issue #2897)
- Added data validation to the `rodex_sendmail_acc*()` commands to ensure that the receiver ID is in a valid range. (#2901, issue #2898)

### Fixed

- Added checks to the waitingroom script commands to ensure that their related waiting room and NPC exist. (part of #2048)
- Fixed the random cell selection of Confusion and Chaos according to their official behavior (random cell in a square area). (part of #2882)
- Fixed the random cell selection of `WE_CALLPARTNER`, `WE_CALLPARENT`, `WE_CALLBABY`, `AM_RESURRECTION` according to their official behavior (random cell in a quare area with minimum and maximum distance). (part of #2882)

- Fixed the Impositio Manus behavior to always overwrite itself regardless of level. (#2890, issue #695)
- Fixed a possible crash when changing the display class of a floating NPC, caused by missing data validation. (#2900, issue #2899)
- Fixed the name of the `Fruit Pom Spider Card` item. (#2902, issue #2896)
- Fixed the `KO_GENWAKU` skill effect, swapping the position of the caster and the target. (#2831)

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `HAT_DIGITAL_SPACE` constant in favor of `HAT_EF_DIGITAL_SPACE`. (part of #2878)
- Deprecated the `kickwaitingroomall()` script command in favor of `waitingroomkick()`. (part of #2048)

## [v2020.10.19] `October 19 2020`

- Updated the `F_InsertComma()` function to work with numbers that are too large to fit in a numeric variable (such as numbers, larger than a 32 bit signed integer, returned by SQL queries). (#2860)
- Extended `getcharid()` to optionally accept a character ID as an alternative to the character name. (#2876)

### Fixed

### Added

- Added the missing mapflag constants `MF_NOMAPCHANNELAUTOJOIN`, `MF_NOKNOCKBACK`, `MF_CVC`, `MF_SRC4INSTANCE`. (part of #2654)
- Added official item script for Rune Boots. (#2806)

### Changed

- Refactored the mapflag related code to reduce repetition. The mapflag constants exposed to the script engine `mf_*` have been changed to uppercase `MF_*` to match their source counterparts. Custom scripts may need to be updated to follow. (#2654)

### Fixed

### Changed

- Changed the script command `gettimetick(0)` to never return negative values. The tick loop interval is reduced from about 50 to about 25 days, but the values are guaranteed to be positive. Since `gettimetick(0)` is only intended to be used for precise calculation of short durations, it is care of the scripter to account for overflows of the counter, treating it as a 31 bit unsigned integer operating in modulo `2**31`. For most uses, `gettimetick(2)` should be preferred. (#2791, issue #2779)
- Updated the Renewal formula for the `RG_SNATCHER` skill. (#2802)
- Refactored the scripts that use `OnTouch` areas and `enablednpc()`/`disablenpc()` logic to warp characters, to use `areawarp()` instead, simplifying the scripts and resolving some possible exploits and issues. (#2798)

- Added a new configuration flag `send_party_options` (`conf/map/battle/client.conf`) to control whether and when to display the party option messages to players, including some cases (on login, when options are changed, when a party member is added or removed) that were previously not available. (part of #2757)
- Added a new configuration flag `display_overweight_messages` (`conf/map/battle/client.conf`) to control whether and when to display the overweight notification message to players. (part of #2757)

- Added missing plugins to the makefiles. (part of #2778)
- Added missing mobs and items in the pre-re database, necessary for loading custom scripts. (part of #2778)

- Changed the behavior when a pet's intimacy drops to 0 to immediately remove the pet rather than leaving it free to roam on the map. A new configuration flag `pet_remove_immediately` (`conf/map/battle/pet.conf`) has been added, to restore the old behavior. (part of #2781)
- Centralized some repeated code related to pet spawning and consolidated the sending of the pet's intimacy and hunger information to the client when appropriate. (part of #2781)
- Extended the `guild_notice_changemap` configuration flag with more fine grained settings on when to display the guild notice. Note: if you are currently overriding this setting, you'll need to update its value with the new meaning. (part of #2757)
- Enforced the use of signed characters on platforms where `char` is unsigned. (part of #2778)

- Fixed the description of the meaning of rows and columns in the documentation for `db/*/attr_fix.txt`. (#2765)
- Fixed the behavior of the Megaphone item script to remove the normal script restrictions (walking, attacking, using skills and items, dropping and picking up items, trading, etc) while the message input box is present and not to be cancelled on death. (#2775, issue #2751)
- Fixed a client freeze when talking with an NPC or using a Megaphone while the Rodex window is open. Rodex and NPC scripts (or megaphones) are now mutually exclusive. (part of #2775)

- Improved data validation and error reporting in the mob skill database. (part of #2691)
- Changed return values of `mob_skill_use()` and `mobskill_event()`. Any third party code that uses them needs to be updated. (part of #2691)

## [v2018.11.18] `November 18 2018`

### Added

- Added an option to prevent character renames when in a guild or a party. This is the official behavior, but disabled by default since it's unnecessary in Hercules. To enable, `char_configuration/use_aegis_rename` can be set to `true` in `char-server.conf`. (#1866, issue #1805)
- Added the script command `data_to_string()`, to return the string representation of the given data (counterpart to `getd()`). (#2304)
- Added/updated packets, encryption keys and message tables for clients up to 2018-11-14. (#2310, #2321)
- Added a configuration option for the maximum delay allowed by `@channel setopt MessageDelay` command, see `chsys/channel_opt_msg_delay` in `channels.conf`. (#2287)
- Added a configuration option for more accurate emulation of the HP display on dead characters. This setting is enabled by default, but the old, less confusing, behavior is available by setting `display_fake_hp_when_dead` to `false` in `client.conf`. (#1215, issues #889 and #840)
- Added `common/packets`, to provide a common interface to the packet DB, shared by all three servers. (#2321)

- Updated the quest variables documentation, converted to the Markdown format in [doc/quest_variables.md](doc/quest_variables.md). (#2256)
- Updated the monster modes documentation, converted to the Markdown format in [doc/mob_db_mode_list.md](doc/mob_db_mode_list.md). (#2255)

- Fixed the messages displayed when enabling or disabling CvC. (part of #1972)
- Extended the `bg_message` string termination fix to all the clients. (#1973)

## [v2018.02.11] `February 11 2018`

### Added

- Added/updated packets support for clients from 2017-12-13 to 2018-01-24. (part of #1957)
- Implemented the official Clan System, including the possibility of customization and a Clan vs Clan versus mode. (#1718, #1964, #1968, related to issue #241)
  - New GM commands: `@claninfo`, `@joinclan`, `@leaveclan`, `@reloadclans`, `@cvcon` and `@cvcoff`.
  - New script commands: `clan_join()`, `clan_leave()` and `clan_master()`; extended `strcharinfo()` and `getcharid()`.
  - Configuration changes: see `conf/clans.conf`, `conf/map/logs.conf`, `db/clans.conf`, `db/*/map_zone_db.conf`.
  - Note: This requires the SQL migrations `2017-06-04--15-04.sql` and `2017-06-04--15-05.sql`.
  - Note: The `npc/re/other/clans.txt` script is now loaded by default in renewal mode.
- Added several (status-icon related) constants to the script engine (through the new `constants.inc` file). (part of #1718)
- Implemented the missing HPM interfaces in the login server (account, ipban, lchrif), added the missing variables into the login interfaces. (#1963, issue #1908)
  - The `_sql` suffix has been removed from the source files in the login server.
  - Functions in `account.c` and `loginlog.c` have been prefixed with `account_` and `loginlog_` respectively.
  - The `chrif_` functions of the login server have been renamed to `lchrif_`.
  - The `server[]` array has been moved to `login->dbs->server[]`.

## [v2018.01.14] `January 14 2018`

### Added

- Added support for the `AllowReproduce` flag in the skill DB. This supersedes the `skill_reproduce_db`. (#1943)
- Added support for the `ZC_PROGRESS_ACTOR` packet. The packet is exposed to the script engine through the `progressbar_unit()` command (available on PACKETVER 20130821 and newer). (#1929)
- Added support for the new item drop packet for the Zero clients. The packet is controlled by the `ShowDropEffect` and `DropEffectMode` item DB flags and ignored by non-Zero clients. (#1939)
- Added support for the new Map Server Change packet 0x0ac7. (part of #1948)

### Changed

- Always enabled assertions and null pointer checks. In order to disable them (very discouraged, as it may lead to security issues), it is now necessary to edit `nullpo.h`. (#1937)

## [v2017.12.17] `December 17 2017`

### Added

- Implemented Homunculus Autofeeding, available on the 2017 clients. The feature can be disabled by flipping `features.enable_homun_autofeed` in `feature.conf`. (#1898)
- Added support for the newly released Ragnarok Zero clients. The client type is controlled with the `--enable-packetver-zero` configure-time flag (disabled by default). (#1923)

### Changed

- Applied script standardization to the Old Glast Heim instance script. (#1883)
- Split packets.h into two files: `packets.h` and `packets_shuffle.h`. (part of #1923)

## [v2017.11.19+1] `November 24 2017` `PATCH 1`

### Fixed

- Suppressed assertions in the Skill DB accessors when called with `skill_id = 0` (normal attacks). (#1910, issue #1909)

## [v2017.11.19] `November 19 2017`

### Added

- Added several missing members to the login interface. (Part of #1891)
- Added support for colored character server population counter in the service selection list. Configurable through `users_count` in `login-server.conf`. (#1891)
- Added top-level command `miniboss_monster` to label monsters as minibosses, and to send them as such to the client. (part of #1889)
- Added support for 2017-10-25 - 2017-11-01 clients. (#1889)
- Added support to display NPCs with player classes, including equipment and styles (best with clients starting from 20170726). This extends `getunitdata()` and `setunitdata()` with support for `UDT_SEX`, `UDT_HAIRSTYLE`, `UDT_HAIRCOLOR`, `UDT_HEADBOTTOM`, `UDT_HEADMIDDLE`, `UDT_HEADTOP`, `UDT_CLOTHCOLOR`, `UDT_SHIELD`, `UDT_WEAPON`, `UDT_ROBE`, `UDT_BODY2`. (#1893)
- Added type constants for the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()` script commands. Existing third party code must be updated to use the new constants (see the pull request description and the command documentation for details). (#1902)
- Added global function `F_GetAmmoType()`, counterpart to `F_GetWeaponType()` for ammunitions. Both functions have now been updated to only check the subtype if the item type is correct (`IT_AMMO` and `IT_WEAPON` respectively). (part of #1902)
- Added support for the Skill Scale packet, available in client versions 20151223 and newer. (#1903)

### Changed

- Applied script standardization to the Octopus Cave instance script. (#1882)
- Applied script standardization to the Ghost Palace instance script. (#1879)
- Applied script standardization to the Sara's Memory instance script. (#1884)
- Extended the script command `setequipoption()` with the possibility to remove item options from an equipment piece. (#1865)
- Updated the `QTYPE_*` constants (`questinfo()`, `showevent()`) to support the new 2017 client icons. (#1894)
- Applied script standardization to the Orc's Memory instance script. (#1872)
- Applied script standardization to the Sealed Shrine instance script. (#1873)
- Extended the global function `F_GetArmorType()` to support costumes and shadow equipment. (#1836)
- Extended the script commands `has_instance()` and `has_instance2()` with support to search instances of type `IOT_NONE`. (#1397)
- Applied script standardization and improvements to the Endless Tower instance script. (#1862)
- Cleared some confusion between skill IDs and indexes through the codebase. Rewritten Skill DB accessors in a safer, more readable way. (part of #1896)

### Deprecated

- The use of numeric type constants with `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()` is deprecated. For technical reasons, no deprecation notice is displayed. (part of #1902)

### Removed

- The `MAX_SKILL` constant has been removed, in favor of the more clear `MAX_SKILL_DB`, to be used in all places that use the compacted Skill DB array. For use with the non-compacted clientside Skill IDs, the `MAX_SKILL_ID` constant is still available. (part of #1896)

### Fixed

- Fixed compilation warnings when compiling with gcc-7. (#1887)
- Fixed the display flag for monsters labeled as `boss_monster` to be that of MVP monsters instead of miniboss monsters. (part of #1889)
- Fixed a subtle error in case `skill->unit_group_newid` overflows, causing certain skill unit entries to get stuck and never get deleted correctly. This can manifest itself with some monster spawns becoming immune to certain AoE spells having the `UF_NOOVERLAP` flag (Storm Gust, Lord of Vermillion, etc). (#1896)
- Implemented MATK support in the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()`. This functionality was previously advertised as available in the command documentation, but was not implemented. (part of #1902)
- Restored View Sprite support in the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()`. This functionality was lost with #1828. (part of #1902, issue #1895)
- Reimplemented the global function `F_GetArmorType()` to reflect the fact that  `ITEMINFO_LOC` returns a bitmask. The function now handles multi-slot headgears and other uncommon cases better. (part of #1902)
- Corrected some incorrect data types passed to the SQL `StmtBind` functions, causing query errors and data loss. Said functions will now have a runtime assertion to ensure the right data type is passed. Third party code needs to be updated to reflect this stricter requirement. (#1901, issue #1531)
- Corrected some RODEX related queries in case `MAX_SLOTS` or `MAX_ITEM_OPTIONS` are set to custom values. (part of #1901)

## [v2017.10.22+1] `October 22 2017` `PATCH 1`

### Fixed

- Fixed a wrong null pointer check in `logmes()`, which caused the command to never log and instead print debug information.

## [v2017.10.22] `October 22 2017`

### Added

- Added the script command `getmapinfo()`, which allows to obtain misc information about a map. (#1852)
- Added an option to restrict party leader changes to characters on the same map. Controlled by the setting `party_change_leader_same_map` (defaults to true). (#1812)
- Added initial support (shuffle packets, obfuscation keys) for clients 2017-09-27, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-11, 2017-10-18. (#1859)
- Added the `noautoloot` mapflag, allowing to disable the `@autoloot` functionality on a map by map basis. (#1833)

### Changed

- Extended the script command `logmes()` with an option to log to the `atcommandlog` table. (#1843)
- Updated RoDEX, with support for packetver `20170419` and newer. (#1859)
- Updated Exp-related packets and handling functions to support values larger than 2 billions (as seen in packetver `20170830` and newer). (#1859)
- Changed the diagnostic message in `skill_init_unit_layout()` to report the skill ID instead of its index. (#1854)

### Fixed

- Corrected the Kafra dialog in case a Doram without the Summoner's Basic Skill attempts to open the Storage. (#1864)
- Changed the cell stack counting algorithm to ignore invisible NPCs, improving the Dancer Quest experience as well as other cases of hidden NPCs blocking off certain cells. (#1827)
- Improved the handling of the `cardfix` value to make it more resistant to overflows, especially in renewal mode. Simplified the related renewal/pre-renewal conditional code. (#1825)
- Fixed some compilation warnings occurring in VS2017. (#1870)

### Other

- New versioning scheme and project changelogs/release notes (#1853)
