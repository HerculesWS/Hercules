### [v2019.07.28] `July 28 2019`

### Added

- Added/updated packets, encryption keys and message tables for clients up to 2019-07-24. (#2498)
- Added a setting to have `@autoloot` take player drop penalties/bonuses into account. See `autoloot_adjust` in `drops.conf` for details. (#2505)
- Added a mob DB field `DamageTakenRate` to change the rate of the damage received by each monster. (#2510)
- Added a setting to allow homunculi to obtain a portion of the EXP gained by their master. See `hom_bonus_exp_from_master` in `homunc.conf`. Note: in order to restore the previous behavior, the setting can be changed to `0`. (#2507, issue #2313)

### Changed

- Converted various packets (`ZC_ACK_RANKING`, `ZC_STATUS_CHANGE_ACK`, `ZC_HAT_EFFECT`) into structs. (part of #2498)
- Changed `pc_statusup()` to send the actual stat value back to the client in case of error. (part of #2498)
- Disabled the `@refresh` and `@refreshall` commands during NPC conversations, causing the character to be stuck on an invisible NPC dialog until relogging. (#2499)
- Extended `@reloadmobdb` to update the currently spawned monsters. (#2500)
- Changed the party sharing checks to avoid unnecessary SQL queries. (part of #2502)
- Extended the `@refine` command with shortcuts to refine every normal equipment (-1), every costume equipment (-2) or every shadow equipment (-3). (#2504)
- Extended the `@refine` command to list the costume and shadow equipments. (#part of #2504)

- Converted the Guild Castle database to the libconfig format, in preparation for future updates. (#2506)

### Fixed

- Sanitized the use of `input()` in all the scripts to work correctly if the minimum accepted value is changed to less than zero in the configuration. It's recommended that third party scripts get updated not to assume a positive value, since the default setting may change in the future. (#2494)
- Fixed an issue in the Sealed Shrine script, allowing to unseal multiple Baphomets under certain conditions. (#2332)
- Fixed an issue that allowed an appropriately created party to enable experience sharing even if outside the sharing range. (#2502)

## [v2018.11.18] `November 18 2018`

### Added

- Added an option to prevent character renames when in a guild or a party. This is the official behavior, but disabled by default since it's unnecessary in Hercules. To enable, `char_configuration/use_aegis_rename` can be set to `true` in `char-server.conf`. (#1866, issue #1805)

- Added a configuration option for more accurate emulation of the HP display on dead characters. This setting is enabled by default, but the old, less confusing, behavior is available by setting `display_fake_hp_when_dead` to `false` in `client.conf`. (#1215, issues #889 and #840)
- Added `common/packets`, to provide a common interface to the packet DB, shared by all three servers. (#2321)

- Fixed the messages displayed when enabling or disabling CvC. (part of #1972)
- Extended the `bg_message` string termination fix to all the clients. (#1973)

## [v2018.02.11] `February 11 2018`
### Added
- Added/updated packets support for clients from 2017-12-13 to 2018-01-24. (part of #1957)
- Implemented the official Clan System, including the possibility of customization and a Clan vs Clan versus mode. (#1718, #1964, #1968, related to issue #241)
  - New GM commands: `@claninfo`, `@joinclan`, `@leaveclan`, `@reloadclans`, `@cvcon` and `@cvcoff`.
  - New script commands: `clan_join()`, `clan_leave()` and `clan_master()`; extended `strcharinfo()` and `getcharid()`.
  - Configuration changes: see `conf/clans.conf`, `conf/map/logs.conf`, `db/clans.conf`, `db/*/map_zone_db.conf`.
  - Note: This requires the SQL migrations `2017-06-04--15-04.sql` and `2017-06-04--15-05.sql`.
  - Note: The `npc/re/other/clans.txt` script is now loaded by default in renewal mode.
- Added several (status-icon related) constants to the script engine (through the new `constants.inc` file). (part of #1718)
- Implemented the missing HPM interfaces in the login server (account, ipban, lchrif), added the missing variables into the login interfaces. (#1963, issue #1908)
  - The `_sql` suffix has been removed from the source files in the login server.
  - Functions in `account.c` and `loginlog.c` have been prefixed with `account_` and `loginlog_` respectively.
  - The `chrif_` functions of the login server have been renamed to `lchrif_`.
  - The `server[]` array has been moved to `login->dbs->server[]`.

- Applied script standardization to the Buwaya Cave instance script. (#1877)
- Applied script standardization to the Eclage Interior instance script. (#1878)
- Applied script standardization to the Hazy Forest instance script. (#1880)
- Applied script standardization to the Malangdo Culvert instance script. (#1881)

### Fixed
- Fixed compatibility issues with the 2013-12-23 client. (part of #1957, issue #1956)
- Prevented the leak of a hidden GM's presence through area packets. (#1200)
- Fixed an unterminated string in the `bg_message()` related packets, with certain client versions. (#1890)

## [v2018.01.14] `January 14 2018`
### Added
- Added support for the `AllowReproduce` flag in the skill DB. This supersedes the skill_reproduce_db. (#1943)
- Added support for the `ZC_PROGRESS_ACTOR` packet. The packet is exposed to the script engine through the `progressbar_unit()` command (available on PACKETVER 20130821 and newer). (#1929)
- Added support for the new item drop packet for the Zero clients. The packet is controlled by the `ShowDropEffect` and `DropEffectMode` item DB flags and ignored by non-Zero clients. (#1939)
- Added support for the new Map Server Change packet 0x0ac7. (part of #1948)

### Changed
- Always enabled assertions and null pointer checks. In order to disable them (very discouraged, as it may lead to security issues), it is now necessary to edit `nullpo.h`. (#1937)
- Disabled the address sanitizer's memory leak detector in the travis builds, since it produced failures in third libraries. (#1949, #1952)
- Applied script standardization to the Nydhogg's Nest instance script. (#1871)

## [v2017.12.17] `December 17 2017`
### Added
- Implemented Homunculus Autofeeding, available on the 2017 clients. The feature can be disabled by flipping `features.enable_homun_autofeed` in feature.conf. (#1898)
- Added support for the newly released Ragnarok Zero clients. The client type is controlled with the `--enable-packetver-zero` configure-time flag (disabled by default). (#1923)

### Changed
- Applied script standardization to the Old Glast Heim instance script. (#1883)
- Split packets.h into two files: packets.h and packets_shuffle.h. (part of #1923)

### Fixed
- Corrected a wrong path displayed in an error message pointing to the map-server configuration. (#1913)
- Fixed the natural expiration of the Poison status when under the effect of Slow Poison. (#1925)

## [v2017.11.19+2] `November 28 2017` `PATCH 2`
### Fixed
- Fixed an item loading failure in RODEX. (#1917, issue #1912)
- Fixed invisible NPCs (such as `FAKE_NPC`) being displayed as novices. (#1918, issue #1916)

## [v2017.11.19+1] `November 24 2017` `PATCH 1`
### Fixed
- Suppressed assertions in the Skill DB accessors when called with `skill_id = 0` (normal attacks). (#1910, issue #1909)

## [v2017.11.19] `November 19 2017`
### Added
- Added several missing members to the login interface. (Part of #1891)
- Added support for colored character server population counter in the service selection list. Configurable through `users_count` in login-server.conf. (#1891)
- Added top-level command `miniboss_monster` to label monsters as minibosses, and to send them as such to the client. (part of #1889)
- Added support for 2017-10-25 - 2017-11-01 clients. (#1889)
- Added support to display NPCs with player classes, including equipment and styles (best with clients starting from 20170726). This extends `getunitdata()` and `setunitdata()` with support for `UDT_SEX`, `UDT_HAIRSTYLE`, `UDT_HAIRCOLOR`, `UDT_HEADBOTTOM`, `UDT_HEADMIDDLE`, `UDT_HEADTOP`, `UDT_CLOTHCOLOR`, `UDT_SHIELD`, `UDT_WEAPON`, `UDT_ROBE`, `UDT_BODY2`. (#1893)
- Added type constants for the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()` script commands. Existing third party code must be updated to use the new constants (see the pull request description and the command documentation for details). (#1902)
- Added global function `F_GetAmmoType()`, counterpart to `F_GetWeaponType()` for ammunitions. Both functions have now been updated to only check the subtype if the item type is correct (`IT_AMMO` and `IT_WEAPON` respectively). (part of #1902)
- Added support for the Skill Scale packet, available in client versions 20151223 and newer. (#1903)

### Changed
- Applied script standardization to the Octopus Cave instance script. (#1882)
- Applied script standardization to the Ghost Palace instance script. (#1879)
- Applied script standardization to the Sara's Memory instance script. (#1884)
- Extended the script command `setequipoption()` with the possibility to remove item options from an equipment piece. (#1865)
- Updated the `QTYPE_*` constants (`questinfo()`, `showevent()`) to support the new 2017 client icons. (#1894)
- Applied script standardization to the Orc's Memory instance script. (#1872)
- Applied script standardization to the Sealed Shrine instance script. (#1873)
- Extended the global function `F_GetArmorType()` to support costumes and shadow equipment. (#1836)
- Extended the script commands `has_instance()` and `has_instance2()` with suport to search instances of type `IOT_NONE`. (#1397)
- Applied script standardization and improvements to the Endless Tower instance script. (#1862)
- Cleared some confusion between skill IDs and indexes through the codebase. Rewritten Skill DB accessors in a safer, more readable way. (part of #1896)

### Deprecated
- The use of numeric type constants with `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()` is deprecated. For technical reasons, no deprecation notice is displayed. (part of #1902)

### Removed
- The `MAX_SKILL` constant has been removed, in favor of the more clear `MAX_SKILL_DB`, to be used in all places that use the compacted Skill DB array. For use with the non-compacted clientside Skill IDs, the `MAX_SKILL_ID` constant is still available. (part of #1896)

### Fixed
- Fixed compilation warnings when compiling with gcc-7. (#1887)
- Fixed the display flag for monsters labeled as `boss_monster` to be that of MVP monsters instead of miniboss monsters. (part of #1889)
- Fixed a subtle error in case `skill->unit_group_newid` overflows, causing certain skill unit entries to get stuck and never get deleted correctly. This can manifest itself with some monster spawns becoming immune to certain AoE spells having the `UF_NOOVERLAP` flag (Storm Gust, Lord of Vermillion, etc). (#1896)
- Implemented MATK support in the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()`. This functionality was previously advertised as availble in the command documentation, but was not implemented. (part of #1902)
- Restored View Sprite support in the `getiteminfo()` and `setiteminfo()`. This functionality was lost with #1828. (part of #1902, issue #1895)
- Reimplemented the global function `F_GetArmorType()` to reflect the fact that  `ITEMINFO_LOC` returns a bitmask. The function now handles multi-slot headgears and other uncommon cases better. (part of #1902)
- Corrected some incorrect data types passed to the SQL `StmtBind` functions, causing query errors and data loss. Said functions will now have a runtime assertion to ensure the right data type is passed. Third party code needs to be updated to reflect this stricter requirement. (#1901, issue #1531)
- Corrected some RODEX related queries in case `MAX_SLOTS` or `MAX_ITEM_OPTIONS` are set to custom values. (part of #1901)

## [v2017.10.22+1] `October 22 2017` `PATCH 1`
### Fixed
- Fixed a wrong null pointer check in `logmes()`, which caused the command to never log and instead print debug information.

## [v2017.10.22] `October 22 2017`
### Added
- Added the script command `getmapinfo()`, which allows to obtain misc information about a map. (#1852)
- Added an option to restrict party leader changes to characters on the same map. Controlled by the setting `party_change_leader_same_map` (defaults to true). (#1812)
- Added initial support (shuffle packets, obfuscation keys) for clients 2017-09-27, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-11, 2017-10-18. (#1859)
- Added the `noautoloot` mapflag, allowing to disable the `@autoloot` functionality on a map by map basis. (#1833)

### Changed
- Extended the script command `logmes()` with an option to log to the `atcommandlog` table. (#1843)
- Updated RoDEX, with support for packetver `20170419` and newer. (#1859)
- Updated Exp-related packets and handling functions to support values larger than 2 billions (as seen in packetver `20170830` and newer). (#1859)
- Changed the diagnostic message in `skill_init_unit_layout()` to report the skill ID instead of its index. (#1854)

### Fixed
- Corrected the Kafra dialog in case a Doram without the Summoner's Basic Skill attempts to open the Storage. (#1864)
- Changed the cell stack counting algorithm to ignore invisible NPCs, improving the Dancer Quest experience as well as other cases of hidden NPCs blocking off certain cells. (#1827)
- Improved the handling of the `cardfix` value to make it more resistant to overflows, especially in renewal mode. Simplified the related renewal/pre-renewal conditional code. (#1825)
- Fixed some compilation warnings occurring in VS2017. (#1870)

### Other
- New versioning scheme and project changelogs/release notes (#1853)
