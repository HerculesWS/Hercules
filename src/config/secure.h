 * Uncomment to disable
 * while enabled, movement of invisible (cloaking, hide, etc [not chase walk]) units is not informed to nearby foes,
 * rendering any client-side cheat, that would otherwise make these units visible, to not function.
 * - "Why is this a setting?" because theres a cost, while enabled if a hidden character uses a skill with cast time,
 * - for example "cloaking -> walk a bit -> soul break another player" the character display will be momentarily abrupted
 * - on the action of unhiding (its a quick effect, ~0.007s in duration), and due to the nature of the skill cast on the client
 * - it was not possible to work around this, and thus why it is optional, comment the line to disable.
