 *  <H1>Entry Reusage System</H1>                                            *
 *                                                                           *
 *  There are several root entry managers, each with a different entry size. *
 *  Each manager will keep track of how many instances have been 'created'.  *
 *  They will only automatically destroy themselves after the last instance  *
 *  is destroyed.                                                            *
 *                                                                           *
 *  Entries can be allocated from the managers.                              *
 *  If it has reusable entries (freed entry), it uses one.                   *
 *  So no assumption should be made about the data of the entry.             *
 *  Entries should be freed in the manager they where allocated from.        *
 *  Failure to do so can lead to unexpected behaviors.                      *
 *                                                                           *
 *  <H2>Advantages:</H2>                                                     *
 *  - The same manager is used for entries of the same size.                 *
 *    So entries freed in one instance of the manager can be used by other   *
 *    instances of the manager.                                              *
 *  - Much less memory allocation/deallocation - program will be faster.     *
 *  - Avoids memory fragmentation - program will run better for longer.       *
 *                                                                           *
 *  <H2>Disadvantages:</H2>                                                   *
 *  - Unused entries are almost inevitable - memory being wasted.            *
 *  - A  manager will only auto-destroy when all of its instances are        *
 *    destroyed so memory will usually only be recovered near the end.       *
 *  - Always wastes space for entries smaller than a pointer.                *
 *                                                                           *
 *  WARNING: The system is not thread-safe at the moment.                    *
 *                                                                           *
