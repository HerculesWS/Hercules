## Description
A reference description of Hercules's mob_db.conf `mode` field.

## Monster Mode Legend:
Constant Name         | Bits    | Value    | Description
:-------------------- | :-----: | :------: | :----------------
MD_CANMOVE            | 0x00001 |        1 | Enables the mob to move/chase characters.
MD_LOOTER             | 0x00002 |        2 | The mob will loot up nearby items on the ground when it's on idle state.
MD_AGGRESSIVE         | 0x00004 |        4 | Normal aggressive mob, will look for a close-by player to attack.
MD_ASSIST             | 0x00008 |        8 | When a nearby mob of the same class attacks, assist types will join them.
MD_CASTSENSOR_IDLE    | 0x00010 |       16 | Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle or walking (without a target).
MD_BOSS               | 0x00020 |       32 | Special flag which makes mobs immune to certain status changes and skills.
MD_PLANT              | 0x00040 |       64 | Always receives 1 damage from attacks.
MD_CANATTACK          | 0x00080 |      128 | Enables the mob to attack/retaliate when you are within attack range. <br/>Note that this only enables them to use normal attacks, skills are always allowed.
MD_DETECTOR           | 0x00100 |      256 | Enables mob to detect and attack characters who are in hiding/cloak.
MD_CASTSENSOR_CHASE   | 0x00200 |      512 | Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle or chasing other players (they switch chase targets)
MD_CHANGECHASE        | 0x00400 |     1024 | Allows chasing mobs to switch targets if another player happens to be within attack range (handy on ranged attackers, for example)
MD_ANGRY              | 0x00800 |     2048 | These mobs are "hyper-active". Apart from "chase"/"attack", they have the states "follow"/"angry". </br>Once hit, they stop using these states and use the normal ones. The new states are used to determine a different skill-set for their "before attacked" and "after attacked" states. </br>Also, when "following", they automatically switch to whoever character is closest.
MD_CHANGETARGET_MELEE | 0x01000 |     4096 | Enables a mob to switch targets when attacked while attacking someone else.
MD_CHANGETARGET_CHASE | 0x02000 |     8192 | Enables a mob to switch targets when attacked while chasing another character.
MD_TARGETWEAK         | 0x04000 |    16384 | Allows aggressive monsters to only be aggressive against characters that are five levels below it's own level. </br>For example, a monster of level 104 will not pick fights with a level 99.
MD_NOKNOCKBACK        | 0x08000 |    32768 | Monsters will be immune to knockback's effect.
MD_RANDOMTARGET       | 0x10000 |    65536 | Picks a new random target in range on each attack/skill. (not implemented)

## Aegis Mob Types:
What Aegis has are mob-types, where each type represents an AI behavior that is mimicked by a group of eA mode bits. 
This is the table to convert from one to another:
