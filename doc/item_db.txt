Upper: Equippable upper-types. Uses the following bitmasks:
	Normal jobs:      0x01 (1)
	Upper jobs:       0x02 (2)
	Baby jobs:        0x04 (4)

	equip the item.

	2^1  002 = Weapon
	2^2  004 = Garment
	2^3  008 = Accessory 1
	2^4  016 = Armor

	2^21 2097152 = Shadow Accessory 1

WeaponLv: Weapon level. Becomes 0 when not specified.

EquipLv: Base level required to be able to equip. It is possible to specify
	 two values, if an item has a maximum level, by using the following
         syntax:

	EquipLv: [minLv, maxLv]

	If only one value is specified, maxLv becomes the current server's
	MAX_LEVEL. If no values are specified, minLv becomes 0.

Refineable: true if the item can be refined, false otherwise. If no value is
            specified, it defaults to true.

      Making apples look like apple juice). The special case are weapons
      and ammo where this value indicates the weapon-class of the item.

BindOnEquip: Whether the item will automatically bind to the character when it
             is equipped for the first time. An item that has this field set,
             will display a confirmation dialog the first time it is equipped,
             and, if accepted, the item will become character-bound.

ForceSerial: Whether the item will be given new unique id or not. When the item
			 have this field as true, the item will be unstackable and new uniqueID
			 will be given to each item.

BuyingStore: Whether the item can be sold via buyingstore, one must also edit
             data\buyingstoreitemlist.txt for client to accept item.

Delay: Delay for an item to be used again. Value is in milliseconds.
       There is a max concurrent number of entries modifiable in
       src/map/itemdb.h as MAX_ITEMDELAYS.

Trade: Item trade restrictions. If this block is omitted, the item will have no
       trade restrictions.
       All the settings in this group are boolean values, unless otherwise
       specified. Default value is false (restriction not set) for any missing
       setting.

	Allowed settings in this block are:
		override: If specified and in the interval [1:100], sets the
		          minimum GM Group ID that can bypass the defined trade
		          restrictions. This is an integer value.
		nodrop: Item can't be dropped.
		notrade: Item can't be traded (nor vended).
		partneroverride: Wedded partners can override the notrade setting.
		noselltonpc: Item can't be sold to NPCs.
		nocart: Item can't be placed in the cart.

		nogstorage: Item can't be placed in the guild storage.
		nomail: Item can't be attached to mail messages.
		noauction: Item can't be auctioned.

Nouse: Defines if an item cannot be used under certain circumstances. If this
       block is omitted, there will be no usage restrictions.
       All the settings in this group are boolean values, unless otherwise
       specified. Default value is false (restriction not set) for any missing
       setting.

	Allowed settings in this block are:
		override: If specified and in the interval [1:100], sets the
		          minimum GM Group ID that can bypass the defined usage
		          restrictions. This is an integer value.
		sitting: Item can't be used while sitting.

Stack: Prevents an item to be stacked more than x times in given
       inventory types. Generally used by 3rd class related skill items.
       Syntax: [amount, type]
    Available types:
       1: Character inventory restriction
       2: Character cart restriction
       4: Account storage restriction
       8: Guild storage restriction
       Note: Stack limit of 0 will disable a restriction.

Sprite: SpriteID will be sent to the client instead of ItemID.
        NOTE: Replaces an item client-side while keeping them separate server-side.
              Think of it as a way to disguise items.

Script: Script to execute when the item is used/equipped.

OnEquipScript: Script to execute when the item is equipped.
               Warning, not all item bonuses will work here as expected.

OnUnequipScript: Script to execute when the item is unequipped.
                 Warning, not all item bonuses will work here as expected.

Inherit: This can be used only in item_db2.conf, and if set to true, and the
         item already exists in item_db.conf, all the missing fields will be
         inherited from there rather than using their default values.
