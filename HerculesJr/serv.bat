REM == How RESTART_9X and RESTART_NT works =========================
REM On Windows 9x only the first 8 characters are significant for
REM labels, and the first matching one is called (RESTART_(9X)).
REM Windows NT calls the exact named label (RESTART_NT).
REM Separation between 9X and NT is required, because CHOICE has
REM different syntax on these platforms or does not exist as all.
