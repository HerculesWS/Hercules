//================= More Information ======================================
//= http://herc.ws/board/topic/302-introducing-hercules-map-zone-database/
//= (TODO: replace with wiki link and detail the wiki page in a decent format ^)
//================= Description ===========================================
//= A unlimited number of zones may be created, a zone may be used to create a
//= set of disabled items, disabled skills and mapflags to be used by as many
//= maps as one chooses.
//= Maps can be linked to a specific zone through the zone mapflag:
//= '<map name><tab>mapflag<tab>zone<tab><zone name>'.
//=========================================================================
//= Available types for 'disabled_skills':
//= PLAYER, HOMUN, MERCENARY, MONSTER, PET, ELEMENTAL, MOB_BOSS, CLONE, ALL and NONE
//=========================================================================
