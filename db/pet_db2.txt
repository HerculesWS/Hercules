// 10. R_Hungry			Amount of Intimacy that is increased when fed.
// 11. R_Full			Amount of Intimacy that is decreased when over-fed.

// 15. Speed			Pet's walk speed. (Defaul: 150)
// 16. S_Performance		Special Performance. (Yes = 1, No = 0)
// 17. talk_convert_class	Disables pet talk (instead of talking they emote  with /!.)
// 18. attack_rate			Rate of which the pet will attack (requires at least pet_support_min_friendly intimacy).
// 19. defence_attack_rate	Rate of which the pet will retaliate when master is being attacked (requires at least pet_support_min_friendly intimacy).

// 21. pet_script		Script to execute when the pet is hatched.
// 22. loyal_script		Script to execute when the pet is hatched (requires at least pet_equip_min_friendly intimacy, independent of pet_script).
//NOTE: The max value (100%) of attack_rate, defense_rate & change_target_rate is 10000.

//In theory you can use any valid script, but it is run only once upon pet
//loading, so it is recommended you use the specific pet scripts:

//petskillattack skillid, skilllv, hits, rate, bonusrate
//Skill attack that triggers while the pet is attacking. Rate is the base
//chance of execution per attack. Bonusrate is an additional success rate when
//intimacy reaches max. If hits is specified and different than 0, it will make
//the pet cast the skill with a fixed amount of damage inflicted and the
//specified number of hits. A value of zero uses the skill's defaults.

//petskillsupport skillid, skilllv, delay, hp%, sp%
//Casts a support skill when the health levels are below the specified hp% and
//sp%. Delay is the minimum time in seconds before the skill can be cast again

//petrecovery type, delay: Cures the "type" status effect after "delay" seconds

//petskillbonus type, value, duration, delay
//Gives bonus stats. Type is the stat to increase (bStr, bLuk), value is the
//amount by which it is increased, duration signals how long the bonus lasts
//delay is the time elapsed after the bonus ends and before it starts again.

//A single pet can have petloot, petskillbonus, petskillattack and
//petskillsupport at the same time, but only one of each.
