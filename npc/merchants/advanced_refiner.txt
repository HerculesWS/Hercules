//= Advanced Refiner
//================= Description ===========================================
//= Refiner that uses Enriched ores to increase upgrade success.
//================= Additional Comments ===================================
//= After a conversation with Doddler, it's been established that the
//= advanced refiner works similar the the "Bubble Gum" item.
//= The success percentage is not "increased" however, if it fails you get
//= a second try. This tries twice at the same time, effectively giving you
//= a re-roll on your attempt.
//= - Dialog is only partly official to iRO.
//= - Uses the iRO position for this NPC.
//================= Current Version =======================================
//= 1.5
