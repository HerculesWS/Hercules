//= Hercules Renewal Primary Scripts File
//=========================================================================
// The idea of this new system is to make scripts more organized
// since the old system was rather messy with all the NPCs in one
// file. Now scripts are organized in to files arraged by type.
// Custom scripts are now in scripts_custom.conf, all other
// scripts are deemed as 'official'. You should place your NPCs
// in to scripts_custom.conf to follow the trend.
//
// Thanks,
//  Ancyker and the rest of the Hercules Team

// Note: "Comments" are all text on the right side of a double slash "//"
// Whatever text is commented will not be parsed by the servers, and serves
